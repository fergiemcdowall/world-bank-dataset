The series supports structural reforms strengthening economic governance across the public sector and new policies fostering more inclusive and open governance. The DPL has been prepared jointly with the European Union (EU) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), leveraging a further US$ 250 million in support of common key policy actions such as the budget, procurement and open governance reforms. The programmatic approach is warranted by the scope and depth of the government's governance reform program, the implementation of which will require time, assistance, and flexibility. This operation is complemented by the transition fund project supporting the implementation of Morocco's new governance framework. This US$ 4 million grant provides technical assistance for the implementation of structural reforms fostering public engagement; performance based budgeting and fiscal decentralization. The series adopts a holistic and integrated approach to enhance its impact. It is supporting governance reforms across the public sector covering the central government; State owned Enterprises, or SoEs and agencies, local governments as well as inter-governmental relations. The Bank has provided policy advice and technical assistance for the design of most policy measures and laws supported by this DPL, with the support from the MNA multi-donor trust fund. The transition fund governance project will support the implementation of these structural reforms. While building on the long-standing engagement with public administration reform, under the Public Administration Reform Loan (PARL) series, this program supports the concretization of the performance budgeting reform through the adoption and implementation of the new organic budget law and procurement decree. This DPL series also delves into new reform areas derived from the constitution such as access to information, public petitions, as well as into the governance of SoEs and local finances."

There are two components to the project, the first component being municipal grants. This component will provide direct municipal grants to municipalities that are hosting the largest concentration of Syrians (i.e., weighting the number of Syrians hosted and their ratio to the host population). Reflecting the increased size of their populations, the Grants will allow municipalities to finance additional public services and programs to help improve living conditions, reduce communal tensions and enhance social cohesion for the benefit of the Jordanians and Syrians living in their jurisdictions. Finally, the second component is the institutional development and project management. This second component will finance two subcomponents: (i) subcomponent 2A - technical assistance to participating municipalities to plan, implement and manage activities funded by the Municipal Grant, as well as project management support to implementing agencies to coordinate, manage and oversee the project; and (ii) subcomponent 2B - capacity building of key Government agencies and vulnerable communities in emergency preparedness, and risk planning, management and financing. The component will finance goods and services."

The project has four components. The first component is support for sanitary and phytosanitary services. This component aims to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of sanitary and phytosanitary services in order to reduce existing obstacles to agricultural and food trade. The component will be structured into following three sub-components: (i) food safety capacity building to establish a roadmap for comprehensive reforms, including key principles for the national food safety control policy and enforcement; (ii) upgrading plant health and phytosanitary system will support upgrading the State Phytosanitary Control Services (SPCS) which is mandated to ensure phytosanitary safety on the import, production, storage, and processing of plant and plant products; and (iii) animal health and veterinary services will support the strengthening the State Veterinary Services (SVS) and promotion of a complementary private veterinary sectors as key elements being considered to provide a suitable environment for improving and securing animal production. The second component is agribusiness value chain development. This component will help develop value chains by partially financing demand-driven investment proposals. It will also support activities for improving seed varieties and quality of seeds entering the market. It has following two sub-components: (i) investment and advisory support for agribusiness value chain development to: (a) provide development support for value chain participants to assist them to establish productive partnerships and prepare sub-project proposals for funding under the project, and (b) investment support for agribusiness value chains; and (ii) seed sector development will help to build on the experience of Second Agricultural Development and Credit Project (ADCP-II) and will support the seed development chain that includes the National Research Institute for Crop Husbandry (NRICH) and its research stations. The third component is financial services to agribusiness. This component will promote growth of agribusiness or agro-food processing enterprises through a line of credit to enhance their competitiveness, increase production and improve technologies, building thus on the sizeable results in lending to agribusinesses and improved skills of participating banks in appraising agriculture-related investment loans, achieved under the Bank's previous intervention. The fourth component is project management. Management responsibility for the project will come under the State Agency for Agricultural Credits (SAAC) within the ministry of agriculture. ACIP will be managed by the Project Management Unit (PMU) located in the State Agency for Agricultural Credits (SAAC)."

The CCRES project will be financed by a combination of the grant funds from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) international waters focal area and from third parties through co-financing and parallel financing. The current direct co-financing stands at $2.0 million from The University of Queensland, however, parallel financing is also significant with $3.9 million in contributions from various research partners towards salary provisions, project management costs and other resources. An additional $21.9 million in parallel co-financing is contributed from World Bank projects directly linked to CCRES: a) Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Program-Coral Triangle Initiative (COREMAP-CTI), and b) Philippines rural development project, which are also part of the GEF IW scaling up partnership program."

Second, the revenue management framework in the hydropower and mining sectors should also be clearly defined to maximize revenues accruing over time to the government for development purposes while attracting good quality investment in the sector. Third, diversification of economic growth sources through a competitive private sector outside the resource sector is critical to ensure the sustainability of growth. As the natural resource sector is capital intensive, it does not provide abundant job opportunities, as opposed to manufacturing, agribusiness or services. Diversified sources of growth are also important to reduce vulnerability to developments and exogenous shocks in narrow set of sectors. Finally, the fourth and fifth priorities for translating increased revenues from the natural sectors into improved public service delivery are a strong public sector capable of managing these revenues effectively coupled with the establishment of sustainable financing mechanisms for schools and health facilities. PRSO 9 supports the establishment of a mining revenue committee and its reporting on fiscal regime policy issues and options in the sector. In education, PRSO 9 supports making available for dissemination school based expenditure reports, to monitor spending in general and the school block grant scheme in particular."

It will issue standard corporate bonds into the capital markets and subsequently issue loans (refinance and pre-finance) to mortgage lending institutions. The second component is establishment of a mortgage guarantee product, targeted at lower income borrowers. The project will fund the product development including testing and financial modeling, and then launch a competitive process, among private or public owned nonbank financial institutions to select a mortgage guarantee agent to implement the project. The project will also provide a line of credit to the project implementing entity on account of the mortgage guarantee agent for the issuance of mortgage guarantee products to eligible lenders. The third component is Housing Microfinance (HMF). This component aims to support the development and piloting of new and or emerging formal HMF products and to demonstrate a sustainable business case for these activities. The fourth component is Technical Assistance (TA) and capacity building. The TA will be provided to support components one, two, and three. The TA will include provision of operational support to NMRC including assistance for bond issuance, mortgage lender training, mortgage consumer protections and financial literacy, housing market information, and impact evaluation of the mortgage market. TA also will be provided for HMF product development and piloting, Microfinance Banks (MFBs) staff training, consumer protection, impact evaluation, and related ancillary support services necessary for establishing sustainable HMF operations."

To achieve the development objectives, five components will create the basic institutions to support the reform processes. First, the project will improve the business climate by simplifying the processes of registering a business and obtaining a license, updating outdated legal framework governing business entry, and introducing electronic payment facilities for business and tax services. Second, fiscal transparency will be enhanced by removing legislative impediments to business and investment. Third, public financial management will improve through the creation of an independent commission for supervising public enterprises. Fourth, targeting social assistance will improve economic reform through the merging of the Social Welfare Agency and the Social Security Fund. Fifth, the project will increase fiscal oversight and controls over public enterprises by improving expenditure efficiency, targeting automation and monitoring the evaluation framework of the social protection system, and ensuring the cost recovery and the long-term financial sustainability of public utilities."

The project has three components. The first component is support to agricultural production, post-harvest, and marketing for selected value-chains. This component responds to the demand by Casamance agricultural cooperatives, and small-scale private operators for support to production, marketing, and commercialization of agricultural commodities. The component supports activities aimed at restoring the missing links in the rice, horticulture, and oysters value-chains. The second component is rural accessibility. This component will carry out a program aiming at improving accessibility of the most isolated rural communities and improving communities' access to roads leading to local markets and agricultural production zones. The third component is project implementation and capacity building in Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR). This component includes four sub-components: (i) strengthening the capacity of key stakeholders, including the Agence Nationale pour la Relance des Activites Economiques et Sociales en Casamance (ANRAC) through consolidation of peace building processes and the fundamentals of DDR for ex-combatants; (ii) carrying-out of three strategic studies on: (a) developing a cadastral plan; (b) developing a geo-reference map of interventions in Casamance; and (c) support to the government in the definition and implementation of a strategy on poles development, which integrates a fiscal framework; (iii) support to project management, results monitoring and evaluation (M and E); and (iv) construction of office facilities for the Regional Development Agency (Agence Regionale de Developpement) (ARDs) and provision of related office equipment."

The project has two components: 1) cash benefits, which will distribute quarterly cash payments to about 5,500 households living below the extreme poverty line; and 2) assistance with the reforms of the cash transfer program and with the project management and implementation, ensuring that all households living below the extreme poverty line are included in the cash transfer program. The additional grant finances the costs associated with scaling up activities under the project's first component concerning quarterly cash benefits, because the negative effects of the dire economic situation in the West Bank and Gaza have pushed more people into poverty. The additional financing also supports the Palestinian Authority's efforts to continue reforms of the cash transfer program. This support includes evaluating the accuracy of the proxy means test formula, reducing the projects inclusion and exclusion errors, and verifying beneficiaries' eligibility through a constant monitoring and recertification process."

This component aims to promote further regional market integration, sector liberalization, and legal and regulatory reforms, and will include subcomponents focused on Technical Assistance (TA), capacity building, and training including the TA to assist the government with preparatory work for the submarine cable FLY-LION3 (From Comoros to Mayotte and Madagascar), including environmental studies feasibility studies and demand analysis. The second component is connectivity. This component will finance (i) membership and participation in the FLY-LION3 cable -- the link between Comoros, Mayotte and Madagascar-- under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement, which will ensure connectivity with LION-2; (ii) advance purchase of additional broadband capacity from East African Submarine System (EASSy), FLY-LION3 and/or LION2 and its use to provide demand stimulation measures by providing affordable bandwidth to key users such as the university, schools, hospitals, etc.; and (iii) additional measures to stimulate demand including by promoting the creation of local ISPs and establishing a carrier-independent Internet Exchange Point (IXP). And the third component is project management. This component will consist of support to finance project management costs including project coordination, procurement, financial management, monitoring & evaluation, communication, environmental and social safeguards, office equipment, incremental operating costs, and audits."

The main aims of the cell captive project were to: review the approach to the legislation and regulations relating to captives and protected cell captives in Bermuda, Guernsey, Isle of Man and Mauritius; and recommend the approach to the legislation relating to protected cell captives for Botswana, taking the objectives of the IFSC into account. This report discusses the findings of the investigation into protected cell captives project. Section two introduces the concept of a captive insurer, sections three to five discusses the concept of cell captives and the need for protected cell captives or incorporated cell captives in the protection of assets of individual funds. The findings of the investigation of the approach to protected cell captives in other jurisdictions are discussed in sections six. Finally recommendations and considerations on the approach to be taken by Botswana are discussed in section seven."

This objective will be achieved through improved forecasts resulting from improved observing networks, the introduction of new technologies, and access to higher resolution global weather and climate products. Service improvements will depend on training both the providers and users of services to be able to tailor information more effectively to users needs. The geographical focus will be countrywide. The project will have social and economic benefits by managing risk in weather-related disasters that disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable populations through improving forecasting, early warning systems and the observed climatology of Yemen. The project consists of the following four components: 1) the first component aims to improve climate resilience in Yemen through institutional strengthening and capacity building by provisioning of weather, climate and water services that meet stakeholders needs by creating the conditions that ensure institutional, staffing and financial sustainability of the key providers; 2) the second component aims to upgrade and expand the observations networks for meteorology, agro-meteorology and hydrometeorology, ensuring that these networks are interoperable; 3) the third component provides for the implementation of a systematic upgrade of the weather, climate and water-related end-to-end services provided to all agencies, communities and individuals; 4) and the fourth component involves program management and knowledge sharing. This last component has three distinct subcomponentsoversight of the overall implementation; support for the program coordination unit; and knowledge sharing including public education and outreach."

The outcome of this component is: operational knowledge inside and outside the Sahel and West Africa Program in support of the Great Green Wall Initiative, or GGWI (SAWAP) portfolio is regularly exchanged through a regional learning hub that networks institutions and individuals that are implementing 12 country investment operations. The second component is the program monitoring support. There are two outcomes from this component. First, additional monitoring tools and training are deployed at regional and country levels to track processes and impacts from the portfolio of projects. Second, the SAWAP portfolio is regularly monitored against a set of thematic and process indicators. Finally, the third component is the project management. The outcome of this component is that the management of the regional BRICKS project is carried out efficiently and effectively."

The First Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-1) is the first of a programmatic series of three DPOs designed to help Cote d'Ivoire reach its stated goal of becoming an emerging market by 2020. The series has been prepared in line with good practice principles for development policy operations in situations of fragility. The series focuses on areas of heightened importance in these settings: (1) strengthening public confidence in government by improving the transparency of budgets and accountability of public officials; (2) building investor confidence through rapid, visible improvements in the business climate; and (3) quickly creating economic opportunities by focusing on potential sources of growth and employment, particularly on labor-intensive exports. The reforms supported by the series reinforce its cross-cutting foundation of governance, including policies to reduce corruption, enhance transparency in public service and in the exploitation of natural resources, and strengthen the oversight role of civil society. Reforms to increase the resilience of the Ivorian economy include increasing the share of revenues from the main export crop, cocoa, received by farmers. Reforms to create jobs focus on improving the business climate, raising private investment, and supporting the growth of promising labor-intensive activities in rural areas, such as cashew production and cotton cultivation."

This component aims to provide support to the institutions in the state responsible for overall integrated water resources management and implementation of the state water policy. The second component is the modernization and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems. The third component is the consolidation and enhancement of irrigation institutional reforms. This component will enhance the efficiency of the Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department (UPID) and strengthen the Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) approach both in the department as well as in the community. The fourth component is the enhancing agriculture productivity and on-farm water management. This component (to be implemented directly by the Department of Agriculture) aims to improve the overall agriculture productivity and water-use efficiency at the field level. The fifth component is the feasibility studies and preparation activities for the next phase. This component is to prepare detailed surveys and designs for future third phase areas. These new areas will be identified by the Government of Uttar Pradesh and will make use of similar design principles (and the lessons learned) adopted under this second phase operation. Finally, the sixth component is the project coordination and monitoring."

      "cdata": "Solomon Islands are a fragile, post-conflict small island state and the poorest in the Pacific when measured in terms of Gross Domestic Product, or GDP per capita. Most of the population is dispersed across rural areas of the archipelago, where they largely depend on subsistence agriculture. This caps food poverty rates, but exposes the population to environmental shocks. Poverty rates are higher in urban areas, where traditional safety nets are weaker and unemployment rates are high. A former British protectorate, the country became independent in 1978 and enjoyed twenty years of moderate but sustained economic growth and improvement in social indicators. A low-level conflict between 1998 and 2003, known as 'the tension,' brought the formal economy and many state functions to a halt. Real GDP per capita, which had been slowly eroding between 1996 and 1999, fell sharply between 2000 and 2002. An Australian-led and financed regional peacekeeping mission, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), stopped the violence and rapidly restored order and basic state functions, particularly in finance. The country has subsequently enjoyed a fairly good security situation, interrupted only by short-lived but destructive riots in 2006, mainly in the capital Honiara. RAMSI presently retains a police and military presence, as well as a large corps of civilians in advisory or in line functions, notably in the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT). Given the overall stability in the country, RAMSI will undergo a significant transition in mid-2013. Although an extensive police presence will remain to build the capacity of the Royal Solomon Islands police force, the bulk of the military component is scheduled to depart, and the advisory support will transition to bilateral programs."

This project focuses on the following geographical areas of production: the southwest around the Nawa region for cocoa, the southeastern regions of Sud Comoe and la Mé for rubber and oil palm, the central and northern regions of Hambol and Gontougo for cashew nuts, and the northern regions for cotton. Project activities are clustered around three technical components, combining value chains and geographic areas to facilitate implementation. The first component promotes a public-private partnership for sustainable cocoa development in southwest Côte dIvoire. The second component supports the expansion and renewal of village plantations of oil palm and rubber in southeast Côte dIvoire. The third component supports the cotton sector and promotion of cashew processing in central and northern Côte dIvoire. Each of the three components is similarly structured with three sub-components, namely improving access to markets, improving productivity in a sustainable way, and introducing institutional development to the value chain. A fourth general component deals with coordination of project activities between the countrys Ministry of Agriculture and the National Investment Program (NIAP)."

The revised project will finance transfers in rural areas only and to reflect the incorporation of an Immediate Response Mechanism (IRM) Component. The revised project development objectives are to: (a) improve the management of the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Program; (b) provide income support to eligible beneficiaries; (c) increase the use of preventive health services and school attendance in rural areas; and (d) improve emergency response through an Immediate Response Mechanism (IRM). Additional financing will consolidate and expand the Bono 10,000 Program, as well as address its implementation bottlenecks by: (a) supporting the de-concentration of program operations; (b) strengthening the information system; (c) supporting reliable payment systems; and (d) investing in beneficiary registries to guarantee fiscal sustainability. While program funding is high by international standards, the fiscal situation in Honduras has significantly deteriorated. Thus the additional credit will: (a) protect financing for poverty-targeted programs; (b) support the government of Honduras in strengthening program operations and consolidating sector-level investments that are not necessarily benefitting the poor; and (c) deepen the World Banks engagement in the social protection sector."

      "cdata": "Afghanistan is undergoing a major security and political transition. At the Kabul and Lisbon Conferences in 2010, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Afghan government agreed that full responsibility for security would be handed over by 2014. The country now faces the prospect of a drawdown of most international military forces that so far have supported the fight against the ongoing insurgency. At the same time, Afghanistan is gearing up for a presidential election in April 2014 which many anticipate to be a difficult process given the complex political environment and challenging logistics. Despite these steps, Afghanistan will need to rely heavily on donor financing to ensure the continued provision of public services and investment through the transition period. At the request of the authorities, this Development Policy Grant (DPG) series is designed to support the government's strategy for developing greater economic and fiscal self-reliance. The reform program is ambitious, especially in light of the upcoming elections, but it is strongly supported by the government, key stakeholders and donors. This program document describes the first in a series of two programmatic grants to Afghanistan. The first operation is in the amount of US$50 million, out of US$100 million for the programmatic series. A programmatic approach is proposed to carry on reform momentum and strengthen reform incentives during times in which political incentives for reforms are typically low due to upcoming election. Moreover, lessons from other operations in Afghanistan favor a carefully sequenced and continuous reform-approach."

The project has three components. The first component is performance-based financing (PBF). This component will support a PBF pilot at the PHC level in eight rayons (or districts) in Khatlon and Sogd oblasts (regions). Under the PBF pilot, Rural Health Centers (RHCs) and their subsidiary Health Houses (HHs) will be eligible to receive a performance-based payment each quarter based on the quality and quantity of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and Non-communicable Diseases (NCD) services delivered. The development and testing of the PBF scheme is currently being financed by a separate preparation grant from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF). The second component is primary health care strengthening. This component will aim to improve the capacity of PHC providers to deliver quality services. It has following two sub-components: (i) quality improvement to finance the training of PHC doctors and nurses from the project districts and selected comparison districts in a six months family medicine training program; and (ii) physical infrastructure improvements to support the improvement of PHC facility infrastructure in the project districts. The third component is project management, coordination, and monitoring and evaluation. This component will finance the expenses associated with the implementation and management of the project at the central, regional, and district levels."

This DPO supports key areas of the reform program with the objectives of: (i) strengthening governance and anti-corruption efforts and putting in place enforcement and evaluation and monitoring mechanisms, implementing key priority areas in the judicial sector to promote the rule of law, and improving public sector accountability and efficiency in the management and use of public resources, and (ii) sharpening competitiveness and enhancing the attractiveness for private investment through improving transparency and governance in the energy sector, reforms in the financial sector, and improving the environment for development of private business. The government is committed to its medium-term reforms in the face of high political, social and implementation risks. The DPO program takes into account the varying speeds of policy development and capacity limitations in the different reform areas. The core set of reforms for the two operations is fully identified. The program under the first operation of the series supports essential reform steps in the areas of governance, public financial management, private sector development, judicial reform, and energy. The second operation of the series will build on the achievements and interim results achieved by the reforms supported by this proposed operation."

      "cdata": "The objective of the National Safety Net Programs for Results Project is to support the Republic of Kenya to establish an effective national safety net program for poor and vulnerable households. An essential component of a cash transfer program is a payment mechanism that delivers payments securely to the intended recipients. While the payment mechanisms for the cash transfer programs have improved significantly, the majority of payments are made using a paper-based system with only limited authentication of beneficiaries' identity. This Disbursement-linked indicator (DLI) aimed to gradually increase the use of payment service providers (PSPs) that: (i) make payments electronically, and (ii) use two-factor authentication. The large distances covered by the program combined with severe capacity constraints within the government administration in Northern Kenya has meant that all key areas of the Hunger Safety Net Program (HSNP) implementation are subcontracted as follows: a) the administrative component, including targeting, enrollment, registration, and case management, is implemented by a consortium of Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) headed by Oxfam GB; b) the payments component is managed by the Financial Sector Deepening Trust, which in turn sub-contracted Equity Bank to deliver payments to beneficiaries through a network of banking agents; c) the social protection rights component, which is designed to spread awareness of beneficiaries' rights, entitlements and responsibilities and to manage the complaint and grievance mechanism, is implemented by help age international; and d) the monitoring and evaluation component has been implemented by oxford policy management, which collects and analyzes data on a range of process and impact indicators."

The project has three components. The first component is maintaining access to essential healthcare services. This component aims to sustain the provision of essential healthcare services to the Jordanian population which is at risk due to the stress on resources resulting from the large influx of Syrian refugees. It has following two sub-components: (i) provision of vaccines and essential drugs to ensure adequate and continuous supply at all public healthcare facilities; and (ii) financing of healthcare services for Jordanians in non- Ministry of Health (MOH) health facilities. The second component is supporting household basic needs. The objective of this component is to help the Government of Jordan (GOJ) ensure the uninterrupted supply of basic household commodities for poor and lower middle class households. The two subsidized products financed under this component are bread (wheat) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders. The third component is project monitoring, auditing, and verification. This component will finance: (i) the costs of two special purpose audits as required for component one; and (ii) the cost of an external auditor, acceptable to the World Bank, who will be appointed to audit the project financial statements covering the Project's 12 months lifetime and for both components one and two."

This three-year PRSC series is part of an integrative approach by the World Bank to support the Government of Mozambique in strengthening the transition of the country towards a resource-rich economy. Mozambique's economic performance over the past two decades has been strong; the government has pursued a structural reform program focused on facilitating private sector-led growth in a context of macroeconomic stability and more efficient fiscal policy. The government has had an uneven performance in implementing reforms designed to expand diversification and promote more inclusive growth through broad improvements in the business environment."

The funds requested under this DPO, including Crisis Response Window (CRW) funds, will support the Government of Samoa (GoS) in responding to the exceptional natural disaster it has suffered through Tropical Cyclone Evan (TCE). The operation is built on two pillars. The first pillar contains reforms to enhance recovery and resilience in disaster management, infrastructure and housing. The second pillar consists of public finance management reforms that support improved management and transparency around the use of public funds at a time of increased expenditure necessitated by the disaster response and heightened fiscal pressures. The operation is also consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS's) approach, which sees a role for the Bank in coordinating donor engagement with the government on development priorities and budget support. This operation will help provide a bridge into a programmatic series of development policy operations envisaged by the CPS."

The AF will: 1) expand the package of primary and secondary services in the current 18 rural districts; 2) introduce demand-and supply-side performance-based financing interventions on a pilot basis in two low-income urban health districts; and 3) extend the project implementation period to October 30, 2015. In addition, the project will strengthen Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) by rolling out and implementing Process Monitoring Evaluation (PME). The PME will generate evidence on contextual factors linked to performance of health providers and access to and utilization of maternal and child health (MCH) services in low-income urban areas supported by demand-and supply-side Results Based Financing (RBF) mechanisms. The PME will strengthen the evidence base for RBF which Government policy makers, program managers and development partners can use to inform key decisions concerning the program and broader health sector financing."

The emergency operation will help address the urgent needs of students displaced from the North to the South of the country as a result of the conflict. It will also mitigate service disruptions more broadly by providing investments needed to protect against the significantly reduced access to education that usually occurs in conflict settings and those characterized by political instability. Activities to be supported through this emergency operation will focus on expanding access capacity and preserving /restoring education infrastructure and services in the targeted zones, which will in turn help preserve education institutions at the decentralized levels where the project will be intervening. Finally, the project will also support the implementation of policy measures related to improving access, equity, and expansion of basic education, as well as the management of the education sector."

The project has three components. The first component is strengthening the institutional, legal, regulatory, tax and governance framework for microfinance. This component aims to: (a) prepare an action plan to assess and reinforce the capacity of the National Federation of Microcredit Associations of Morocco (FNAM); and (b) support activities contributing to the strengthening of the legal, regulatory, tax and governance framework of the microfinance sector. This component will also finance goods, services, travel, and incremental operating costs incurred by the Project Management Unit (PMU) in the implementation and management of the project. It has following two sub-components: (a) prepare an action plan, including a comprehensive assessment to reinforce the capacity of the FNAM; and (b) carrying out studies to inform the development of a modern legal, regulatory, tax and governance framework for microfinance. The second component is strengthening the market infrastructure, product innovation and funding sources for microfinance. This component focuses on activities aimed at: (a) building common platforms improving the efficiency and effectiveness of microcredit associations; (b) building market infrastructure in support of microenterprises; and (c) promoting the strengthening and diversification of funding. It has following three sub-components: (i) promoting innovative common platforms and new products for Microfinance Institutions (MFIs); (ii) building market infrastructure for micro entrepreneurs; and (iii) strengthening and diversifying funding sources. The third component is integrating microfinance into a national financial inclusion strategy. This component aims to integrate the national microfinance roadmap into a wider, comprehensive national financial inclusion strategy. In a first step, this component aims to conduct a cross-cutting stocktaking exercise of all previous and ongoing activities aimed at promoting financial inclusion, putting the microfinance sector in a larger financial sector development context. In a second phase, this component aims to build on the findings of the aforementioned activities to develop a comprehensive national financial inclusion strategy, to be developed in a structured consultative process with all key public and private sector stakeholders, and develop an action plan with specific objectives and targets to achieve the aims of the strategy, as well as a clearly defined Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) framework to measure progress."

The operation is in line with the strategic focus of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY10-13 and contributes directly to outcomes related to building sustainable agricultural development and market access. The CPS recognized that in order to sustain recent growth in the agriculture sector and its significant contribution to a robust growth in non-oil economy there is a deliberate need to increase agricultural productivity. The Nigerian Government has unprecedented opportunities to accelerate the country's development. Realizing the objectives of the transformation agenda will be essential to preserving stability in Nigeria. Agriculture is a major focal point of the transformation agenda. Agricultural growth in staples has the greatest impact on poverty reduction. The study identified significant potential for agricultural growth and poverty reduction through sector policies and investment, particularly those fostering improved productivity in food staples. One of the conclusions from the study is that Nigeria is unlikely to meet millennium development goal under its current growth path unless there is a significant improvement in agricultural productivity and in efficiency of public spending."

Under the AF, specific to the six participating states, changes will be made to the intermediate indicators, to include state level and commodity specifics, and revision of targets to account for the additional financing. The new strategy seeks to attract private investment in processing and milling, and other commercial aspects of agriculture around nucleus farms, with associated small-holder linkages such as out-grower schemes and contracting farming arrangements. AF will draw lessons from a number of successful models of contract farming arrangement in the agribusiness subsector in Nigeria including the malting companies, Thai Farm and Dutch Agricultural Development and Trading Company (DADTCO) farms. Within this framework, private investors will enable a transformation process to higher levels of productivity, better quality and production."

This program document describes a stand-alone, single tranche, financial sector stability credit of US dollar 30 million to support the Government's efforts to address financial sector vulnerabilities that remain critical to macroeconomic stability and economic growth. The actions supported under the Development Policy Credit (DPC) form part of a broader, medium term Government program aimed at reinforcing banking sector stability and paving the way for the development of a robust and more inclusive financial sector. The key components of this medium term program are also described in detail in the document. Sufficient overall progress towards the objectives of the medium term program would allow the Bank to provide additional support in the form of a second DPC within about 18 months."

This component will seek to develop basic features of a social protection system, as outlined in the SSDP 2011-2013, and build government capacity to implement the project, through two interrelated sub-components. This component will focus on providing support to Government of the Republic of South Sudan (GOSS) in the development of a social protection policy, as well as putting in place the necessary implementation and coordination capacity. It has following two sub-components: (a) support for a social protection system. This sub-component will support GOSS to put in place the building blocks of a Social Protection (SP) system through assistance with the drafting of a social protection policy and putting in place a set of basic operational tools; and (b) capacity building and project management. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Cooperatives, and Rural Development (MoAFCRD) will serve as the lead project implementing agency and will be responsible for the overall management and coordination of the project. The second component is public works. The objective of this component is to provide income for youth and women from poor households through a seasonal transfer, linked to participation in public works, in order to increase and sustain household assets, and smooth consumption during lean seasons. The third component is skills development. The objective of this component is to provide youth from poor and vulnerable households with access to livelihood opportunities through comprehensive skills development training comprised of technical, entrepreneurship and life skills. Through this component, short term skills training, based on market demand, will be provided to rural and urban poor youth, males as well as females, aged 18-30 years."

It will support the current sector institutions, as well as the preparation, implementation and full functioning of the new; legal and institutional framework resulting from alignments with the Constitution of Kenya 2010. It will also support integrated and participatory basin planning, including developing the requisite knowledge base and building capacity and institutional partnerships for effective water management and planning. The overall objective of this component will be to strengthen the enabling institutional and legal framework to sustainably advance Kenya's vast water sector investment program in order to achieve water security and climate resilience. It has following two sub-components: (i) support for water sector transition and reforms and (ii) strengthening water management and planning. The third component is support for project implementation. This component will support the establishment of the Project Management Unit (PMU) to provide for effective project implementation through the completion of the First Kenya Water Security and Climate Resilience Project (KWSCRP-1) and throughout the reform period. This component will finance the required office space, goods (e.g., vehicles), equipment (e.g., computers), staff, consultant services, travel, training and operating costs that will allow the PMU to carry out its responsibilities for project implementation."

This stand-alone development policy operation supports the authorities' efforts to (i) deepen executive accountability, (ii) protect poverty reduction progress made in recent years, and (iii) prepare for a rapid economic recovery as the political transition ends and the security situation improves. While the credit will primarily translate into financing programs from the emergency priority action plan 2013-14, particular attention is given to the policy actions aimed at: (i) strengthening controls on budget and transparency, (ii) protecting pro-poor expenditures, (iii) restoring financial sustainability and investment capacity in power and irrigation sectors, and (iv) improving public financial and investment management. The operation fully shares the objectives of the World Bank Group's interim strategy note for FY14-15, and is aligned with the World Bank's Strategy for Africa. The operation is also part of a larger regional response to the crisis in the Sahel. While Mali is at the epicenter of the crisis, it is broadly understood that some of its causes, and the responses, have to be found at the regional Sahelian level. Thus, development policy operations are also being processed in Niger and Burkina Faso. A World Bank regional response, taking the form of projects to strengthen resilience and promote regional integration, while building knowledge on demographic and spatial Sahelian challenges was also in the making by May 2013."

Sound macroeconomic policies coupled with limited external imbalances have helped Poland maintain economic growth despite the slowdown and economic uncertainty in Europe since 2008. Notwithstanding these positive developments over the past few years, Poland is not immune to the protracted recession in the Euro area. Poland's economy has performed well during and after the 2008 global financial crisis. Strong macroeconomic fundamentals, including limited macroeconomic imbalances at the onset of the crisis, large and diversified domestic economy, close trade and supply chain linkages to Germany and adequate policy mix prior to and during the crisis, helped the economy withstand external shocks. The growth in government spending was contained by: a) a temporary fiscal rule limiting increases in all newly enacted and existing discretionary expenditure items to one percentage point over the rate of inflation (CPI); and b) a nominal freeze of the budgetary sphere wage bill, and c) phasing out of early retirement schemes."

The project has two components: The first component is upgrading of the existing foxtrot platform. Foxtrot is the only field in Block CI-27 currently in operation. Gas and a small volume of oil are transported via pipelines to the Vridi terminal in Abidjan, where the gas is sold to the Azito and Compagnie Ivoirienne de Production dElectricite (Private IPP) (CIPREL) power stations and the oil to the Societe Ivoirienne de Raffinage (Ivorian Refining Company) (SIR) refinery. The supply lines and facilities that service the existing foxtrot platform will be reconfigured to ensure reliability and uninterrupted gas supply after the field expansion. The second component is addition of a new production platform, wells and pipelines to develop the adjacent Marlin field within the CI-27 block. Under this component the Marlin field will be developed as a new separate four-leg fixed platform with eight slots and five wells. The Marlin platform was ordered in February 2013, after a 2-year delay, resulting from the unstable political situation in Cote d'Ivoire, and gas payment arrears of the power sector."

The project aims to build the infrastructure necessary to advance microfinance access to the region as a whole through developing a network of financial literacy trainers, developing financial literacy tool kits, and producing demand-side knowledge that can significant improve the ability of financial service providers to serve women and youth. There are three components to the project. The first component is the demand-side analysis of access to finance constraints amongst women and youth. This component will finance a demand analysis in Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia consisting of: i) demand-side surveys; ii) focus group discussions; iii) existing household survey analysis; and iv) geographical strata analysis that uncovers barriers to accessing and using the formal financial system for women and youth. The second component is to develop and implement financial literacy modules targeted to youth and women. This component seeks to develop and implement a financial education tool kit targeted to low-income, unbanked women and youth in Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. Finally, the third component is the south-south learning and training of key Microfinance Institutions (MFIs). This component will enhance the capacity of MFIs to effectively serve women and youth through targeted learning exchanges between MFIs in Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia, and leading MFIs in MENA."

Proactive integrated urban development strategies are urgently needed to address social exclusion, and create effective and long-term sustainable governance to benefit all residents. The value added of this operation lies in the potential knowledge partnership with the municipality. Belo Horizonte can become a leading laboratory of experimentation with new urban planning and management ideas and processes, in light of the knowledge the Bank brings to the client in specific issues such as housing development, resettlement practices, social programs, climate change adaptation and mitigation and results-based management. The operation began preparation in 2011 and has experienced delays; however no slippage or reversal of prior actions has occurred during this time. The operation was appraised and negotiated with the client during 2011-2012. The project has been pending resolution of internal clearances within the client administration, which have since been resolved. It has been confirmed that the project's prior actions continue to guide municipal policy and remain valid."

There are three components to the project, the first component being quality improvement of basic education. This component aims at improving the accountability chain of the results chain for improving the quality of learning in the early grades of primary education at four levels. The first will be to provide performance financing education grants to District Education Authorities (IEF) under performance-based contracts (PBCs) between Regional Education Authorities and IEFs to improve the management of the education district and the quality and quantity of services they provide to schools in terms of supervision, support and advice, and teacher training. The second component is the strengthening equity in access to education. This component aims at reaching out-of-school children and providing them with a better quality education. This will be done by providing additional assistance to less advantaged areas in terms of new primary schools and by ensuring that all children notably in selected Daaras receive a quality basic education based on a well-defined curriculum. Finally, the third component is the supporting project management and capacity building."

The project has four components. The first component is agriculture value chains development in Bas-Congo. This component will increase the agricultural supply capabilities of farmers organizations and provide basic rural infrastructure in order to strengthen the targeted value chains and better supply markets, including Kinshasa. This component will finance consultant services to provide technical assistance (TA) and support services to farmers organizations and benefiting institutions; works (the construction of technical and collection platforms, rural roads and upgrading of electricity network); and goods and equipment. This component has following two sub-components: (i) enhancing agricultural supply capabilities; and (ii) support to rural infrastructures. The second component is special economic zone of Maluku. The development of the Maluku Special Economic Zone (SEZ) will provide access to much needed industrial land equipped with critical infrastructure and a more friendly business environment for investors and private sector operators, all of which have been identified as binding constraints in the 2006 investment climate assessment. This component has following three sub-components: (a) facilitation of Public-Private Partnership (PPP); (b) strengthening the capacity of relevant ministries in SEZ development; and (c) physical infrastructure. The third component is proactive business development. This component will improve the business environment with a view to promoting investments and support productive activities in the targeted value chains and poles. It aims at supporting and operationalizing the government approach to Strategic Partnerships Along Value Chains (SPAVC) that was presented to and well received by development partners at the end of 2012 in Kinshasa. It has following three sub-components: (1) project development fund for investment promotion; (2) targeted regulatory reforms; and (3) trade facilitation at the port of Matadi in the Bas-Congo. The fourth component is coordination, monitoring, communication and impact. This component will strengthen the ability of government to implement the project in a coordinated and integrated manner based on existing structures, which will be strengthened through TA. It will also ensure coordination of the involved ministries. It will also be in charge of communication in collaboration with civil society organizations."

This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional financing grant in the amount of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 116.1 million (equivalent to US$180.00 million) to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for the ongoing project. The main purpose of the Additional Financing (AF) is to: (i) finance the costs associated with the implementation of part of original project first component (Recovery Plan of Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo, the National Railway Company of DRC - SNCC) that could not be funded because of an unanticipated financing gap and (ii) scale up the activities of project first component by expanding the SNCC work force downsizing program to Year 2013 retirees, and the activities of project second component in favor of river transport operations and civil aviation regulation. The AF will include a restructuring to introduce the following changes: (i) adjusting some results indicators and targets; (ii) splitting the SNCC workforce downsizing sub-category into two; (iii) amending several covenants in the original grant agreement to reflect changes in the political and economic situation as well as the actual time necessary to fulfill these covenants; and (iv) extending the project's closing date by 24 months to December 30, 2017, to complete the activities and fully achieve the development objectives."

The project has four components. The first component is provision of environmental sanitation and water supply services to priority low income areas of the GAMA. The objective of this component is to increase the access to environmental sanitation and water supply services in low income areas of the GAMA with a strong focus on liquid sanitation. This component also includes the development and implementation of a hygiene and sanitation behavior change campaign targeted at low-income households, and a major learning and dissemination effort aimed at informing a large-scale institutionalized approach to upgrading sanitation in low-income communities. The second component is improvement and expansion of the water distribution network in the GAMA. The objective of this component is to improve and expand the water distribution network in order to provide piped water to the targeted people living in low income communities in the GAMA. This component will also support the acquisition and installation of water meters and other equipment, as well as the provision of services, aimed at improving water demand management and reducing nonrevenue water. The third component is planning, improvement and expansion of GAMA-wide environmental sanitation services. The objective of this component is to develop integrated GAMA-wide plans for liquid and solid waste management and drainage, and to finance critical elements to improve collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater and septic sludge. Under this component the project will work closely with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to engage the private sector to strengthen sustainability of treatment facilities and expand services in target areas through business development support. The fourth component is institutional strengthening. This component will provide technical assistance (TA) to municipal, metropolitan and national institutions, including the promotion of private sector initiatives. It will also support the development of social accountability mechanisms aimed at applying pressure on those responsible for the services to ensure they are properly operated and maintained."

Further enhancing the economy's potential over the medium term and reaching high-income status will require more structural reforms, particularly at the micro level, to bolster competitiveness and boost private savings. This document describes a Euro 624.1 million (USD 800 million equivalent) Competitiveness and Savings Development Policy Loan (CSDPL) to Turkey. It is a one-tranche stand-alone operation. The objective of the program supported by the proposed operation is to facilitate Turkey's growth to high-income status by bolstering competitiveness and boosting domestic savings, thus reducing external vulnerabilities over the medium term. This operation is a critical part of the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which was endorsed by the Executive Board on March 27, 2012. The DPL will contribute to the following expected CPS outcomes under the competitiveness pillar: (i) sustained macroeconomic and financial stability and strengthened exports, domestic savings, and external resilience and (ii) improved investment and business climate; deepened and broadened access to finance. The operation will also contribute to deepening reforms for improved competitiveness, one of the main strategic priorities in the 2012 Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regional strategy."

The project has disbursed 40% of the original loan and is now being implemented at a fast pace, such that the development objective is expected to be met a year ahead of schedule. All conditions outlined in OP10.00 for additional financing have been met. Other proposed changes include increasing the financing percentage from 80% to 100%. Expected outcomes of investments on two additional combined heat and power (CHP) plants proposed to be financed with the additional financing are an additional 54 megawatts of electric capacity and 46,700 thousand cubic meters (tcm) of gas saved, increasing current outcome indicator targets by 60% and 53% respectively."

The additional financing would address the financing gap to allow PAF II to do so. The additional financing is proposed for a period of four years. The changes to the project are: (a) extension of the closing date of the original project; (b) revised targets of outcome indicators to reflect scaling-up of investments and slight adjustments to proposed indicators; (c) renaming and broadening the original component C, innovations and special programs, to component C, product development, market linkages and pilots, to better describe the innovative activities proposed under the additional financing; and (d) renaming and broadening the original component E, administration of PAF II, to component E, project management, planning and monitoring and evaluation (M&E), to integrate monitoring and evaluation activities as well as consultancies (like technical audits and special studies) outside of PO support into component E."

This component aims to support improvements to the quality of care related to maternal health, child health, and infectious disease interventions at selected hospitals in Liberia through the provision of performance-based incentives to support: (a) improved clinical practice; (b) adherence to well-established and defined clinical and treatment protocols; (c) health worker motivation (both intrinsic and extrinsic); (d) structural improvements (e.g. availability of drugs and commodities, and health facility rehabilitation); and, (e) improved management capacity, governance, monitoring and record keeping at health facilities. It has following two sub-components: (1) performance-based financing to address the systemic bottlenecks related to poor quality of care, and health system deficiencies; and (2) management and capacity building to provide intensive technical support to build the institutional capacity required to manage the PBF approach. The second component is improving health worker competencies to address key health-related concerns at selected health facilities. This component will complement efforts to improve the quality of care at target health facilities (discussed under first component), by improving the availability and competencies of health workers in these facilities, in critical specialist areas- obstetrics, pediatrics, general surgery and internal medicine. It has following two sub-components: (i) Graduate Medical Residency Program (GMRP) to support the design and implementation of a nationally accredited GMRP in defined critical specialist areas (obstetrics, surgery, pediatrics, and internal medicine, with a cross-cutting focus on anesthesiology); and (ii) in-service training programs to mid- level health cadres. This subcomponent will leverage the teaching capacity made available under subcomponent 2.i to provide specialized training in critical specialist areas to mid-level cadres (midwives, nurses, and Physician Assistant (PAs) in target hospitals as well as satellite health centers. The third component is project management. This component will support the operational capacity of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) to effectively manage the project. This will include support to the operational costs of a project- specific unit i.e. the HSSP coordination office- within the MoHSW that will be responsible for coordinating project activities."

The project has 3 components. (1) Extension of electricity transmission and distribution systems component will provide access to electricity to about 10,300 new users located not only in Monrovia but also outside of the capital, along the corridor to the town of Kakata. In addition, the transmission line along the corridor will have the capacity to connect around other 6,000 new consumers if additional financing becomes available. (2) Construction of facilities for off-loading, transport, and storage of heavy fuel oil (HFO) and support for optimization of HFO procurement component will support the government's decision to replace current expensive diesel-based generation with less costly HFO-based thermal generation. There are both physical and commercial aspects to optimizing the supply of fuel. Firstly, more reliable HFO supply will require physical investments in HFO off-loading, transport and storage facilities. Secondly, it requires improving HFO procurement practices. (3) Support for the expansion of supply options and for the strengthening of the sector's institutional capacity component will support the overall strengthening of Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energys institutional capacity to plan and implement electricity access programs."

      "cdata": "The wave of democratization that the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has experienced since the start of the Arab Spring has also reached Morocco, although its experience has been a reasonably peaceful one with social demonstrations taking place regularly across the country during 2011 and only sporadic outbursts of violence noted. This social movement started with calls for political change, a curbing of corruption and a more inclusive development process. In March 2011, the King of Morocco proposed a broad and comprehensive package of political reforms that were approved in a constitutional referendum held on July 1, 2011. The new constitution sets the basis for a more open and democratic society, provides mechanisms for the construction of a modern state of law and institutions, and lays the foundation for extended regionalization. These changes have followed on the heels of other reforms already undertaken since the current King came to power. Successive national governments have overseen an impressive political, economic and social transformation, with a marked acceleration of structural reforms in recent years. Sound macroeconomic management has produced solid foundations, and the country was on a recovery path from the stagnation of the 1990s when a series of adverse external shocks hit the economy, starting with the 2008 financial crisis. However, as shown, none of these factors provided total immunity to the rising tide of dissatisfaction and to the pressure from the outstanding development issues and challenges. The program aims to strengthen the schools sector's institutional arrangements in the short term, in ways that in the medium term will: (i) increase access to school education, especially for rural girls and boys at the lower secondary level; (ii) improve the quality of teaching and learning in primary and lower secondary education; and (iii) enhance efficiency in decentralized governance of the schools sector."

The operation supports efforts seen as crucial by the PA to overcoming the urgent fiscal issues, reducing the PA's reliance on foreign assistance for recurrent expenditures while increasing the efficiency of government expenditure programs. In addition, the operation supports improving governance and transparency in the areas that are important for better management of public finances. DPG V, as envisaged in the 2012-2014 interim strategy note, remains a key instrument aimed at supporting the PA's strategic priorities, advancing the policy dialogue, and also providing essential financing for the PA's budget."

The project has three components. The first component is labor intensive public works. The short-term objective of this component will be to provide immediate employment for youth with no or little education through Labor Intensive Public Works (LIPW). It will promote the participation of women by selecting activities that are supportive of women employment and reserving a percentage of the LIPW jobs specifically for women. This component will also (with third component) support the mainstreaming of LIPWs into national policies, strategies and procedures and the establishment of a permanent capacity for LIPWs in the country. The second component is skills development. This component aims to improve youth employability by offering youth with different skills levels within their first training experience. This component has following three sub-components: (1) development of initial vocational training through a dual training approach for economic sectors (sub-component 2-1 A) and establishment of a demand driven training system and provision of training (sub-component 2-1 B); (2) apprenticeship program; and (3) entrepreneurship training and provision of follow up support to entrepreneurs. The third component is institutional capacity strengthening and project management. The purpose of this component is to: (a) strengthen the capacity of private and public sector institutions to engage in an informed policy dialogue on skills and employment on a regular basis, e.g. through technical capacity strengthening and the creation of a mechanism for consultations and collaboration; and (b) improve the knowledge base on employment and youth."

The project has three components. The first component is capacity building. Under this component activities will be financed to strengthen the capacity of National Housing Bank (NHB), qualified intermediary institutions, and Qualified Primary Lending Institutions (QPLIs). The aim will be to develop new financial products, loan standards, risk management tools, and financial literacy and consumer protection capacity. In addition, pilots will be designed, launched and monitored. Building upon and complementing National Housing Bank (NHBs) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems and processes, this component will also support an impact assessment to independently assess the social and household level impact of the project. The second component is financial support for sustainable and affordable housing. This component will finance NHB to refinance, directly or indirectly through qualified intermediary institutions, low-income housing loans made by QPLIs to primary borrowers to purchase, build or upgrade their dwelling. NHB has recently prepared a refinancing scheme for secured low-income housing loans to borrowers with formal and informal incomes. NHB will develop guidelines (to be formulated and reflected in the projects operations manual) for the provision of alternatively secured housing loans to formal and informal borrowers. The third component is project implementation. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be set up within NHB to help implement the project, carry out monitoring and evaluation, be responsible for legal issues and grievance redressal, overseeing and monitoring the social and environmental due diligence (including conducting annual third party audits of QPLIs), keeping the projects operations manual updated, and financial management and carry out any procurement necessary under the project. Low-income housing expertise will also be added to the PIU to provide technical inputs to the procurement of consultants services under component one. External communications on the project will also be covered by NHB staff. Lastly, NHB will also take on responsibility for dissemination and communication activities under its own budget, such as conferences or workshops."

The design of this operation has benefited from close collaboration with the Government, development partners, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), and various stakeholders. This operation builds on the decentralization and public sector reforms supported by previous and ongoing World Bank operations. It targets key medium term challenges to improving the quality of service delivery to Rwandan citizens. In recognition of the limited citizen participation and ownership of the development process, the Government has identified the decentralization process as the key focus for its accountable governance reforms. The Bank proposes this operation under challenging circumstances and a fluid aid environment. The financing provided through this operation will help the Government maintain public expenditures and service delivery in priority areas that are relevant for poverty reduction. In addition, while a lack of financial resources may also reduce the Government's ability to implement planned reforms, this operation will help the Government maintain momentum in important reform areas such as capacity building, public financial management (PFM) and social accountability."

This project will provide much needed financial assistance to poor and food insecure households while helping to protect human capital and laying the foundation for a national safety net system for the whole country for the medium-and long-term. In the short term, the project will finance cash transfers to increase and smooth food consumption of poor households and improve their ability to cope with shocks, while enhancing and protecting the human capital accumulation of their children. In parallel, the project will help to start setting-up parameters of an effective national safety net system which in the medium-and long-term could protect households in absence of shocks but could also be scaled-up in times of crisis. Some of the lessons learned includes: (i) a strong institutional framework for social protection policy is necessary for setting-up a safety net system; (ii) sustainable strategies to support chronically food-insecure households require among others, regular cash transfers for periods of at least between 24 to 36 months; (iii) rigorous Management Information System (MIS) can inform strategic decision-making; and (iv) good targeting is necessary to provide support to those who are most in need."

The project has two components. (1) Improving maternal and newborn health service delivery at community, primary and secondary levels component objective is to improve MNH service delivery at health facility and community level through two sub-components. The sub-components will dovetail the almost complete support provided by the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) to renovate, refurbish and equip health centers, including reinstating adequate provisions for waiting shelters for expecting mothers. Building on infrastructure improvement supported by MCA, the project will contribute to the supply-side improvements which are fundamental to strengthen the quality and utilization of health services. (2) Training of health professionals and Village Health Workers (VHWs) and improving monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity component will be solely financed through IDA financing and have two subcomponents. (2A) Training health professionals and VHWs will support an ongoing MOH program for training doctors, nurse anesthetists and midwives to achieve an acceptable standard of competency in the delivery of MNH. (2B) Improving M&E capacity will support the strengthening of the Health Management Information System (HMIS) in all districts and build the capacity of M&E personnel at the central and district levels."

President Yayi's Government has demonstrated a renewed commitment to a substantive reform agenda since earning a second mandate and enjoying a majority coalition in the National Assembly. Over the past 18 months the Government has implemented difficult reforms at the port of Cotonou, has proceeded with meaningful anticorruption efforts, has made progress in strengthening public financial management, public procurement processes in particular, civil service reform has accelerated, and important steps have been taken in improving the business enabling environment. Some of these efforts were met by stiff resistance, and implementation is proving difficult. The Government has nonetheless demonstrated considerable resolve in proceeding with this reform agenda. Eight PRSC supports this reform effort, strengthens and reinforces the substantial progress achieved in these key areas and provides needed financial resources to help maintain macroeconomic stability."

This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional loan in an amount of US$20.00 million to the project. The additional loan will help finance the costs associated with scaling up activities of a well-performing project in order to enhance the impact. This project paper also seeks the approval of a restructuring consisting in minor changes to the Project Development Objective (PDO) and related changes to the results framework. There are no new safeguard or fiduciary issues applicable to the additional financing (AF), which will use the same environmental and social management framework as the original project, updated in 2011. In terms of outcomes, the AF will support the preparation and implementation of more than 1,000 additional plans benefiting 31,600 additional families, compared to about 1,500 plans and 53,600 families under the original project, bringing the cumulative totals to about 2,500 plans and more than 85,000 beneficiary families. An additional financing in Peru may have a shorter processing time than a completely new project and may allow continuity of project operations."

This Emergency Project Paper (EPP) details a Global Partnership for Education Fund (GPEF) grant in the amount of US$76.5M to support a BERP in Sudan. This operation is expected to be financed through a grant from the GPEF, which will play an important part in complementing other partnership assistance to the Government of Sudan's (GoS's) efforts to build and develop basic education. The project aims to construct 2000 classrooms to alleviate the rising student-to-classroom ratio in the medium and long term, as enrollments continue to rise. The projects also aims to increase access and improve the quality of education through the school grants program in selected areas, which together with the provision of textbooks, will reduce the cost of schooling for households and improve the learning environment. The project will target school construction interventions towards rural communities, targeting states which have a relatively large percentage of its population in rural areas."

The program will also involve a range of administration, oversight and support activities to be undertaken by the relevant central government entities responsible for the various elements of the implementation of the Program. The first phase of the USMID will run over a period of six years (FY 2013/14-FY 2018/19) at a total cost of US$160 million. The main aim of the program is to enhance the capacity of the targeted municipalities to improve urban service delivery in the context of a rapidly urbanizing society in which significant service delivery responsibilities have been decentralized."

It also contributes directly to the three pillars around which the World Bank's program is structured: 1) growth, competitiveness, and employment; 2) service delivery to citizens; and 3) sustainable development in a changing climate. The program supports an ambitious Government initiative in the agriculture sector and builds on extensive dialogue between the World Bank and the Government of Morocco (GoM) and is underpinned by a large body of analytical work and sector operations. The program has benefited from a broad range of analytical work recently completed by the World Bank and others. The program also builds on the outcomes and experience from past and ongoing World Bank operations in water and irrigation, integrated rural development, human development, and public sector administration reform."

The Government of Mauritius continues to diversify the economy to enable the country to achieve a higher income status in the medium term. Since independence in 1968, economic growth in Mauritius has been built on a long tradition of economic and institutional reforms. This DPL series supports the strengthening of the institutional, policy, and management tools required to address some of the challenges posed by these reforms. The fiscal position is improving, and the government achieved greater debt consolidation in 2012 than had originally been expected."

The aim of this component is to support participating state governments program priorities through selected disbursement-linked indicators focusing on the achievement of tangible and measurable results over the project period as follows: (a) improving teacher effectiveness through better deployment, based on needs, including: (i) deployment to hard-to staff schools; and (ii) deployment in core subject areas (English Language, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology); (b) improving regular measurement of student achievement; (c) strengthening school-based management committees participation and capacity for supporting school management and accountability; and (d) supporting stronger partnerships with the private sector to improve the relevance of technical and vocational schools, with emphasis on skills for employment. The second component is technical assistance (US$25.0 million). The objective of this component is to provide technical assistance channeled through two levels: (a) state level (US$20 million)- supporting participating states towards achievement of Disbursement-linked Indicators (DLIs), and the associated institutional capacity strengthening; and (b) federal level (US$5 million)- supporting the Federal Ministry of Education (FMOE) and Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) in overall project coordination and in providing the enabling environment in line with national policies, and in ensuring sustainability and scaling-up of successful activities in other potential states, for instance in Edo state."

The operation supports four areas that are central to the Government's reform program: (1) tax reform will support the Government's tax policy and administration reforms and its improvements in international tax information sharing. Together, these reforms are expected to mobilize tax revenue and facilitate the international exchange of tax information; (2) modernizing public procurement practices will significantly increase accountability and transparency and reduce transaction costs, since 37 percent of non-financial sector public spending is done through procurement; (3) increasing the efficiency of debt management; a major challenge for debt management in Panama is the lack of a medium-term debt management strategy. In particular, while overall guidelines such as the development of the domestic debt market and the smoothing of the debt profile exist, there is no formal debt management strategy in place. Such a strategy will establish target ranges for selected indicators of financial risk after assessing the cost-risk tradeoffs of different alternatives; and (4) and expanding and improving targeting of social transfer programs."

The Government of Tanzania (GoT) has begun to implement a strategy to place the power sector on a more sustainable path. The discovery of important offshore natural gas reserves presents Tanzania with a potentially transformational opportunity for the country. The Government is determined to, and has started the process of, implementing an appropriate policy framework for the optimal use of future natural gas revenues. A programmatic approach is being proposed to support the Government in addressing the above challenges. The operation is consistent with the objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY12-15 and the Africa regional strategy. The development objective of the program is to: (i) strengthen the country's ability to bridge the financial gap in its power sector; (ii) reduce the cost of power supply and to promote private sector participation in the power sector; and (iii) to strengthen the policy and institutional framework for the management of the country's natural gas resources."

This component has following two sub-components: (1) help the Borrower to develop systems to coordinate and manage safety nets programs for the poor and vulnerable; and (2) finance the cost of the management, coordination, and monitoring and evaluation (M and E) activities under this and the other two project components. The second component is the pilot cash transfer program with accompanying measures to boost household productivity (US$36.3 million). This component is for supporting the development and to boost the productivity of chronically poor households and serve as the cornerstone of Cameroons social safety net. Accompanying measures are to be developed to maximize the impact of the cash transfers on the welfare and productivity of beneficiary households. The third component is the public works program pilot (US$5.9 million). This component is for developing and piloting a labor-intensive public works program aimed to help vulnerable households deal with exogenous shocks (such as droughts or floods). The public works activities are to be coordinated with the cash transfer program so as to facilitate its implementation and reinforce its effectiveness."

This second operation will deepen the policy program contained in the first operation, which was submitted to the Executive Board in June, 2012. The programmatic series supports poverty reduction through higher growth, stronger governance, and greater economic resilience. The series is structured in three pillars: 1) building private-sector growth and generating employment; 2) improving governance and public resource management; and 3) increasing resilience and reducing vulnerability. Overall long-term growth projections remain positive but dependent on commodity shocks and on public investment efficiency, while inclusive growth will depend on the economy's ability for structural transformation. Overall, Burkina Faso's macroeconomic framework is judged to be appropriate. Burkina is expected to continue to generate economic stability through prudent fiscal policies, strong financial assistance from donors, and membership of the regional economic and monetary union."

The project has following two components: (1) sunshine schools program support - installation of 100 megawatt (MW) rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in Beijing. This component will install 100 MW of distributed rooftop PV systems in about 800 schools and other educational institutions in Beijing under the Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) model for large-scale rooftop solar PV deployment. Similar to the Energy Service Company (ESCO) business model adopted by the central government as a key market mechanism to scale up energy efficiency investments, the RESCO will take the performance and financial risk of the investment by signing an energy service performance contract (ESPC) with each school and university, which will pay the RESCO only for the solar PV electricity it consumes. The Bank loan will be on-lent to the RESCO by the Beijing municipality; and (2) technical assistance (TA) for developing local capacity for scaling up solar energy deployment, project implementation, and other priority energy policy initiatives of the Beijing Municipal Government (BMG). TA activities include: (i) demonstration of the RESCO model for large-scale grid-connected rooftop solar PV deployment in Beijing municipality, provision of engineering and technical support in relation to PV systems to Yuanshen Company, and independent monitoring and evaluation of implementation and results of such model; (ii) demonstration of two-way metering in Beijing municipality; (iii) establishment of an online monitoring system for rooftop PV systems and a solar energy information portal in Beijing municipality; and (iv) improvement of renewable energy education in schools and other educational institutions in Beijing municipality."

The EMCC proposes to support economic management reforms to enhance competitiveness for sustained growth and poverty reduction. The EMCC will focus specifically on three elements of competitiveness: (i) macroeconomic stability; (ii) transparency, efficiency and accountability of the public sector; and (iii) an enabling business environment that promotes private sector development. The operation will also look at two cross-cutting themes: (a) protecting the poor from adverse effects of Vietnam's economic transition and competitiveness-related reforms; and (b) promoting greater data and policymaking transparency. Analytical work and policy dialogue will aim to ensure that these cross-cutting issues are appropriately taken into account in the reforms supported under the operation. The design of the EMCC is based on feedback from the government and development partners, and lessons learnt from implementation of the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series."

The level of skills in Afghanistan is low and formal training for mid-level skills competence, though it exists, is not standardized and/or benchmarked to acceptable sub-regional or regional standards. The support will respond to the situation through: a) strengthening and improving the overall institutional system, b) providing incentives for development of TVET schools and institutes in that provide formal technical training; c) training of technical teachers; and d) developing labor market information systems and Management Information System (MIS) to monitor the whole sector. All these interventions will be underpinned, and informed by robust linkages between the training providers and the labor market. The strength and relevance of the project lies in it being market-oriented, with a pivotal role for the private sector in management and decision-making in the skills delivery system."

The credit will help finance the costs associated with alleviating the emergency in the country's agriculture sector caused by the 2012 drought. The drought caused extensive losses to the country's field crops, i.e. wheat, sunflower, and particularly corn (for example 60 percent losses in corn production), leading to a shortage of animal feed. Without immediate support to affected farmers the livestock sub-sector will be under significant risk for destocking and loss of capital, with potential long-term negative consequences. The project will help to reduce the risk of destocking by providing conditional cash transfers and technical assistance (awareness and training) to farmers in the most affected districts, so as to maintain their ability to plant spring crops, and particularly corn and wheat. Corn is an especially important crop because pastures are scarce in Moldova, and corn is the main animal feed, both in the form of grain and silage. Corn is also an important staple for Moldovans, as it used in the local diet for the traditional dish called mamaliga."

The operation contributes to the second strategic theme of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to reduce social vulnerability and build a more stable society by ensuring that vulnerable Rwandans benefit from growth. The operation complements the Bank's Poverty Reduction Support Financing (PRSF) series which supports the policy and institutional actions that are focused on promoting inclusive growth, economic transformation and good governance. In January 2011, the Government approved a National Social Protection Strategy (NSPS) that aims to establish a comprehensive and integrated SP system. The overall objective of the NSPS is to 'build a social protection system that tackles poverty and inequality, enables the poor to move out of poverty, helps reduce vulnerability and protect people from shocks, helps improve health and education among all Rwandans, and contributes to economic growth.' The SSPS-2 will help the Government of Rwanda (GoR) implement its NSPS, building on the Bank's support to the SP sector in Rwanda over the last six years that started with the Decentralization and Community Development Project (DCDP) and the Community Living Standards Grant/Credit (CLSG/C)."

This component will support the project implementing entity to invest in 516 kilowatt peak capacity of grid connected solar photovoltaic without storage, to kick-start a staged implementation strategy over the medium term, installed and managed at technically suitable locations as approved by the Government of Kiribati that have been identified with associated inverters to enable grid in-feed at each location. The second component is maintenance program and capacity building. It will support the project implementing entity to implement the investment through a design, supply and install contract for the solar photovoltaic installation with operations and maintenance provisions to cover the entire project implementation, and to gain experience in operations and maintenance and build capacity to initiate and manage future investments. The third component is project management. This component will support the recipient to effectively manage the fiduciary aspects of the project (including procurement and financial management) through the central fiduciary unit. It will also support the project implementing entity to effectively manage the technical aspects of the project through its project support team."

The objective of the proposed program is to support policy reforms in three key areas of the Government's comprehensive economic strategy: the investment climate, trade policy and trade logistics, and economic governance. Over the past decade, Morocco has made good progress in carrying out business environment reforms, but the actual impact of these reforms, albeit positive, has been insufficient. Looking forward, the challenge will be in the implementation and coordination of all the policies that affect private sector development, investment and job creation. In this context, the ECSP programmatic DPL series is designed to support the reform of several key cross-cutting constraints that will favor greater competition between business stakeholders and more effective policies to spur competitiveness."

The proposed operation will be a Financial Intermediary Lending (FIL) with one component (Lines of Credits). The Lines of Credits will provide Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFI) loans to eligible PFIs for the purposes of on-lending as sub-loans to eligible beneficiaries or Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) for the carrying out of sub-projects. The operation will enhance the role of financial institutions in economic growth through financing and developing the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector in Jordan. A special focus would be placed on providing increased long and medium-term financing for these enterprises' investment. The operation will comprise a line of credit channeled through the Central Bank of Jordan to banks that either have an active MSME portfolio or the willingness and capacity to develop one. The banks will then on-lend the funding directly to micro and small enterprises or MFIs that will on-lend to MSMEs. The participating banks could be incentivized through various mechanisms such as tenor, having access to training and capacity building under the MSME Regional Technical Assistance (TA) Facility and through enhanced amounts, in case the lending proposals support on-lending to those market segments that face the biggest market failures, such as lending to viable MSMEs in remote areas."

On-budget funding will support the implementation of key elements of the Government's ECE program (program 239, complemented by decision 60). The SRPP will reimburse Government investments under the following eligible expenditure programs: (a) lunch subsidies3 for disadvantaged children aged 3-54, which will encourage participation and full day preschool attendance; and (b) salaries, including social and health insurance contributions, for contract preschool teachers to ease the shortage of teaching staff. Finally, the second component is the national early childhood education policy development and capacity building. The project will also finance technical assistance (TA), training expenditures, and operating costs to support capacity building and the further development of ECE policy over the coming years."

Ethiopia has made impressive progress in improving health outcomes and is among countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with a good chance of attaining some of the health MDGs. There is a need to enhance accountability of the health system by shifting the emphasis from inputs to results. Ethiopia has to accelerate the on-going efforts to institutionalize monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems that provide reliable and timely information on program results. This will further strengthen evidence-based planning, particularly at the facility and district levels. In a rapidly evolving health system, credible evidence from diverse sources available on a frequent basis will be essential to increasing accountability and strengthening management. Such shift needs to build on successful engagement of communities through the health extension workers moving toward a functional health system by delivering results."

The additional credit will help to scale-up ongoing activities related to expansion of access and productive use of electricity, contributing to the project's development impact for households and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The Additional Financing (AF) will support connecting an additional 48,000 households to the electricity grid as part of the second phase of the Electricity Access Rollout Program (EARP). In addition, the AF will support scaling up of 'green connections' associated with energy efficient solutions; increased uptake of solar products such as solar water heaters and solar photo-voltaic systems; low-cost products such as ready-boards to make it affordable for low-income households to get connected to the electricity grid; and productive uses of electricity to promote increased use of electricity by SMEs. The additional activities have been estimated to be implemented in a timeframe of about 3 1/2 years. Therefore an extension of the closing date of the original credit to June 30, 2016, is required and is within three years of the closing date of the original credit."

The works will include works to the road surface and pavement, drainage improvements, restoration of shoulders and road furniture such as guardrails, road signs and marking. The second component is the institutional support and capacity building. This component will finance activities to strengthen the RMF's and Ministry of Public Works and Highways, or MPWH's capacity for road asset management, including axle load controls through technological connectivity of the control stations with RMF's headquarters in Sana'a and installation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipment and software for improved communication with the road users. Finally, the third component is the transport sector studies. This component will finance technical assistance to address deficiencies and inefficiencies in transport infrastructure provision, maintenance and operation, at the same time support preparation of investments with potentials for other donors' financial support. This will include feasibility and preliminary engineering and operations and maintenance studies to assess the potential of public, private and/or public private partnership investments in the transport sector in Yemen, including public transport and operation of Sana'a and Aden airports and of Al-Hodeidah seaport."

This program document presents a Third MSW Development Policy Loan (DPL 3) to the Kingdom of Morocco in the amount of Euro 100 million (US$ 130 million equivalent). This new series builds on the excellent sectoral dialogue with the Government, the overall success of the previous two operations and the need to consolidate medium-term reforms. It will be implemented in parallel with the second phase (2013-2017) of the Government's ongoing 15-year National Solid Waste Program (PNDM) and will support its transition to full implementation and roll-out, while focusing on the overall coherence of the sector with the new decentralization agenda. In this context, the programmatic series aims to support the Government's efforts to improve the economic, environmental and social performance of the MSW sector. The measures supported by this DPL focus on: 1) strengthening governance, particularly demand-side governance, in the sector by improving accountability, transparency, and access to information, and by providing citizens and civil society with new and effective opportunities for engagement and voice; 2) anchoring long-term institutional and financial sustainability of the sector in line with the new decentralization agenda; 3) upgrading the country's environmental monitoring and control system; and 4) developing a financially viable and socially inclusive waste recycling sector. Finally the program is implemented in close collaboration with other partners."

There are three components to the project, the first component being Improving Climate Resilience of the WCR. This component will implement measures to strengthen the climate resilience of the economically critical WCR, which is a key Government of Samoa (GoS) objective under the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR). Works will improve the road pavement between Vailoa junction in Apia and Faleolo International Airport (approximately 26 km) by raising and strengthening vulnerable sections of the WCR, sealing shoulders, and improving longitudinal and cross drainage. The second component is the vulnerability assessment of the Samoa road network. This component involves technical assistance that will directly support the SPCR by bringing about transformative change in the way that climate change is addressed in the Samoa roads sector. Finally, the third component is the project management and operating costs. This component will also provide funding for specific inter-project SPCR coordination activities, such as: (a) knowledge exchange and lessons learned to feed into the coordination of the SPCR at a programmatic level; (b) resources for GoS officials to participate and contribute to overall SPCR processes; and (c) monitoring and evaluating project results."

This program document states a Reengagement and Reform Support Credit (RRSC) to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for SDR287.75 (US$440 million equivalent). It will be a standalone development policy operation (DPO) program aimed at supporting the full normalization of relations between Myanmar and the World Bank as well as the Government's efforts to undertake critical institutional and policy reforms in the implementation of its medium-term development strategy. In terms of IDA resources, Myanmar is eligible for exceptional support as a reengaging country. Since Myanmar is projected to be at a low risk of debt distress after arrears clearance, IDA resources will be provided on credit terms, per the stipulations of the credit allocation system agreed with IDA donors for the IDA 16 period (FY12-FY14). Going forward, the Government realizes that a key challenge will be to ensure that these reforms translate into improved living standards for the majority of the population, and that gains registered are sustained. The program document is divided into six sections, including this introduction. Second section discusses the country context which gives an overview of Myanmar focusing on the political and economic context, recent economic developments, macroeconomic outlook, and debt sustainability. Third section presents the Myanmar Government's development program; fourth section discusses how the Bank is supporting the government's program, while section fifth describes the DPO. Sixth section outlines implementation issues, including risks and mitigating measures."

As part of the technical assistance provided under Component 4, the additional financing will partly fund key studies aimed at consolidating the rural WSS sector, favoring the entrance of new investments and operations in the sector. In addition, the additional grant will finance technical cost overruns incurred that affected Component 2 (rural water supply and sanitation coverage in the Atlantic and Alto Wanky y Bocay areas)."

This component supports institutional strengthening: capacity of key national, regional, local, and community organizations engaged in disaster risk and sustainable land management (DRM and SLM) will be strengthened through the provision of equipment and training; and awareness rising: awareness about the risks of flooding and land degradation will be enhanced through targeted information campaigns at national and local levels. The second component is community-based activities for adaptation and sustainable land management. this component supports community-based activities in watershed and flood-prone areas: resilience to flooding will be strengthened through targeted pilot activities at the local level that will enable communities to better manage disaster risk and land degradation; community-based activities in cropland and grazing land; community-based sustainable forest and wetland management: communities will be assisted in preparing sustainable financing plans and in designing small income generation activities in and around select protected areas and forests to reduce pressure on forest resources and restore ecosystem services. The third component is early warning, monitoring, and knowledge systems. This component supports Early Warning System (EWS): A nation-wide EWS will be developed to alert communities of upcoming possible flood events and allow them to take appropriate actions to protect lives and property, through enhanced collaboration and communications between the national hydro meteorological services and the Togolese Red Cross; and environmental monitoring. The fourth component is project management. For the project to be effectively implemented, project management functions including fiduciary management, monitoring and evaluation (M and E), technical supervision, reporting and audits, will be covered under this component."

The single tranche operation supports reforms to improve the efficiency of public expenditures and public financial management, to strengthen health systems, and to improve the targeting of social assistance and social inclusion. The PEPBG will help the FYR Macedonia access international financial markets to address an expected financing gap in 2013. In the current difficult financial environment, a partially-secured financing structure would facilitate FYR Macedonia's access to market funding at a longer tenor and under more favorable terms than would otherwise be possible. Beyond the current turmoil, the PEPBG will help FYR Macedonia preserve continued market access at reasonable terms, expand over the medium-term its name in the international financial market and help the domestic financial market to develop. The operation is part of the World Bank's additional crisis-related assistance to FYR Macedonia aimed at mitigating the impact of the renewed Euro zone turmoil."

The project has three components. The first component is development and implementation of an island level integrated SWM system. This component aims to build the institutional capacity of the island councils and communities in the five islands to plan and implement an island level integrated SWM program to minimize the environmental risks to the country's marine and terrestrial assets while reducing GHG emissions. It has following four sub-components: (i) community participation in source segregation of solid waste to create community awareness on the environment and public health implications of poor SWM in the respective islands and solicit community participation for source segregation of household level solid waste; (ii) implementation of an island level recycling and composting program at the Island Waste Management Centers (IWMCs) to finance: (a) the construction of a concrete pad for composting with a drainage system for leachate collection at each of the IWMCs; and (b) training of staff to undertake simple windrow composting at the IWMCs; (iii) institutional capacity building of the island councils and communities for planning and managing an effective island level integrated SWM system; and (iv) development of a strategy to operationalize the European Union (EU)- financed IWMCs in the atolls of the central province. The second component is development of institutional arrangements and implementation of a waste transfer system for off-island disposal of residual solid waste. The objective of this component is to develop an effective, working institutional model to transfer residual waste from the participating islands of Ari Atoll to the Thilafushi island facility and demonstrate the use of this model for residual waste transfer for all central province atolls. The third component is project management. The objective of this component is to establish an effective mechanism for project implementation, including monitoring and reporting of the implementation progress. Implementation support will be provided by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) staff posted at the island offices of the five targeted islands for technical oversight and coordination among the participating island councils that will have the primary responsibility for island-level implementation."

This program document states a first governance and growth support credit for the Republic of Senegal in the amount of SDR 35.8 million (US$55 million equivalent). This operation is the first of a new series of three Governance and Growth Support Credits (GGSCs), following a series of two Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs IV and V) completed over 2009-2011. The operation supports the recipient's efforts to improve economic governance by strengthening government accountability, public sector performance, and promoting growth through private sector development. Policies and reforms supported by this operation are well aligned with Senegal's National Strategy for Economic and Social Development (SNDES), which the Bank supports. The operation is also fully consistent with the objectives of the Bank's FY13-17 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), to be presented to the Board in January 2013. The operation is rooted in the World Bank's Africa strategy. The operation is aligned with the first pillar of the Africa strategy employment and growth and emphasizes the governance foundation of that strategy. By helping create fiscal space, it also aims to improve the government's capacity to cope with external shocks the second pillar of the strategy. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has slowed to levels not much above the rate of population growth and poverty remains high. The economy has shown little structural change, a continued dependence on remittances to fuel domestic demand, a growing reliance on capital-intensive exports while labor-intensive sectors faltered, and thus little job creation. The economy has suffered from the global slowdown, commodity price shocks and instability in neighboring countries, which has been exacerbated by the weakness of the domestic reform agenda."

Under the project, local governments will develop new communal development plans, prepare annual investment plans, and identify local development projects in strategic, holistic and multi-sectoral manner in collaboration with local communities, local communes, and deconcentrated technical services, the private sector and civil society. The second component is implementation of the rural land legislation and enhancement of local dispute resolution mechanisms. With the legal and regulatory framework for land tenure now in place from earlier phases, the component seeks to support the implementation of the land tenure policy and law. This will be pursued through: (i) the establishment and operation of rural land tenure services at commune level, village land tenure commissions, and village conciliation commissions; (ii) land titling operations; (iii) strengthening of capacity of local actors and rural communes to carry out land titling processes efficiently and transparently; and iv) dissemination of the law to increase men, women and illiterates' awareness about their rights, and pave the way for a more gender-balanced access to land. The third component is local and regional investments. Component three will support communes in promoting socio-economic growth and sustainable development through the financing of strategic local development investments, for all the 302 rural communes in the 13 regions. The fourth component is sustainable land and forestry management. This component aims to support restoration and protection of natural resources, forest and biodiversity in the larger ecosystem landscape related to agricultural expansion. It will include natural resource management and protection of select ecosystems beyond the community-based investments of third component and capacity building of first component above. The fifth component is project management, monitoring and evaluation. This component's objective is to ensure that the project components and activities will be effectively carried out, coordinated, monitored and regularly evaluated."

These reforms are vital to support the system of cities in Colombia, in which cities are able to grow to their highest potential, and be engines for sustainable growth in the country. This programmatic engagement covers a range of financial, knowledge and convening services across multiple sectors including urban development and housing, urban transport, logistics and connectivity, water and sanitation and disaster risk management. The DPL program aims to reflect the multi-sectoral priorities of this programmatic engagement with an organizing focus on improving the sustainability, productivity and inclusiveness of Colombia's urban system. The economy expanded by a solid 5.9 percent in 2011 - one of the best growth performances in the region. Private domestic demand, supported by high consumer and investor confidence and access to cheap credit, led the growth process. On the supply side the expansion was spear-headed by the oil/mining, financial services, and commerce sectors. The growth process was accompanied by employment creation as reflected in the decline in the unemployment rate from 11.8 to 10.8 percent in 2011."

The First Development Policy Loan (DPL1) (US$45 million) will be the first of a two-part Social Inclusion DPL series that aims at supporting the social inclusion reform agenda of the Government of Peru (GoP). The first phase of the social inclusion reform program, supported by this DPL1, will focus on the establishment of the new Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion (MIDIS) to initiate the social policy reforms under its responsibility. The second phase of the reform, which will focus on the implementation and consolidation of these reforms, is expected to be supported by a second DPL (Social Inclusion DPL2), planned for FY14. The DPL1 is being presented to the Board together with the Social Inclusion Technical Assistance Loan (TAL). The TAL will support the development of the second phase of reforms and, as such, will provide a bridge of technical support between the two DPL operations. Peru has achieved consistent economic growth, declines in poverty and inequality, and improvements in social indicators over the past decade. However, the Government recognizes that many social and income disparities remain pervasive in the country. Despite the prevalence of social programs, they are fragmented and ineffective in providing a coherent and consistent package of support to the poor. The Government has, therefore, announced a Growth with Inclusion plan that mainly aims at: (i) providing equal access to basic services, employment, and social security; and (ii) reducing extreme poverty, with an emphasis on rural poverty. The Government has created MIDIS to spearhead a large part of this agenda with a focus on the reform of social policies and programs."

There are five components to the project. The first component is quality improvement of MIDIS's programs. This component includes: provision of support to design and pilot activities aimed at improving the quality control of MIDIS's programs by: (i) developing user's participation and accountability mechanisms for the MIDIS's programs. First component contributes to the Project Development Objective (PDO) by supporting activities that improve the performance of MIDIS's programs through accountability mechanisms that institutionalize channels for user's feedback; and the development of planning, information, monitoring and evaluation tools for MIDIS's decentralized offices that coordinate the provision of social programs in the territory. Second component is improving knowledge management, information and communication. This contributes to the PDO by supporting activities that improve the performance of MIDIS's programs and strengthen MIDIS's capacity to monitor social inclusion policy through the implementation of an integrated information platform that includes data from different programs; the interconnectivity of local targeting units that are strengthened with trained staff on information management, monitoring and customer service; and the development of a national communication strategy that includes different approaches for different population groups. Third component is strengthening of MIDIS's capacity on results orientation, monitoring and evaluation. This contributes to the PDO by supporting activities that strengthen MIDIS's capacity to monitor social inclusion policy 27 through the development of information dashboards to oversee infant malnutrition and development plans; and technical assistance to improve the evaluation of programs processes, potential effects and impacts. Fourth component is strengthening of human resource management and capacity. This contributes to the PDO by supporting activities that strengthen MIDIS's systems and capacity to improve the performance of MIDIS's programs through the introduction of result-oriented human resources management practices. Fifth component is support to project administration. This component will finance the activities related to management and implementation of the project, including the strengthening of the UCPS's (Unidad de Coordinacion de Prestamos Sectoriales - Coordinating Unit for Sectoral Loans) team to be able to facilitate, coordinate and monitor implementation."

There are three components to the project, the first component being trade facilitation, trade policy, and regulations. This component builds on the success of trade facilitation and trade policy activities under First Trade Development Facility (TDF-1), and will consist of a number of inter-related activities aimed at improving transparency, predictability and lowering associated compliance costs for traders. Trade facilitation activities will focus primarily on improving inter-agency coordination and supporting the adoption of modern risk based approaches to managing regulatory compliance in non-customs agencies, including reform of non-tariff measures. The second component is the diversification and competitiveness.  This component includes a new set of activities aiming to support improved private sector capacity to improve productivity and compete in international markets, focusing on the non natural resources sectors (in particular outside of mining and hydropower). Activities will facilitate the more effective participation of small and medium sized enterprises in the international economy, better skills and labor standards in the manufacturing sector and support to women's economic empowerment. Finally, the third component is the mainstreaming aid for trade. This component will provide for support to the next generation of Lao PDR's 'aid-for-trade' governance framework as part of efforts to move to a full program based approach for trade and private sector development. The project is financed via a multi donor program, including a multi donor trust fund grant with contributions from Australia, the European Union, Germany and Ireland, and a grant from the World Bank/International Development Association."

This program document states an Economic Reform Grant, a stand-alone development policy operation (DPO), to the Union of the Comoros. The single tranche DPO, in the amount of SDR 3.3 million (US$5 million equivalent), supports the implementation of core reforms in Comoros's Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (PRGSP), at a time when the country is aiming at reaching the Completion Point under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC CP) by end 2012. A previous DPO, the Economic Governance Reform Support Grant (EGRSG), in an amount of US$3 million equivalent, was approved by the Board on June 1, 2010 and disbursed in October 2010. In the politically difficult context of the late 2010 elections, slower than expected implementation of reforms and slippage in macroeconomic performance resulted in delays in the preparation of the planned second DPO. Since mid-2011, the authorities have rekindled the reform process, taken steps to bring the budget under control, and shown a renewed commitment to advancing on structural and institutional reforms. The main goal of the operation is to support government-owned reforms in four out of the six axes spelled out in the country's PRGSP, namely (i) axis one, on economic stabilization and equitable growth, emphasizing improvements in fiscal policy and public financial management; (ii) axis two, on strengthening key sectors by focusing on institution-building and ensuring a broader role for the private sector, with this operation's focus on the electricity sector; (iii) axis three, on strengthening governance and social cohesion, focusing on improvements in core government personnel management systems and stepping up the fight against corruption and fostering transparency in the issuance of fishing licenses and agreements; and (iv) axis six, on promoting environmental sustainability and civilian security, emphasizing disaster risk management."

The DPL will support the government's program aimed at strengthening competitiveness, which is prioritizing the development of a stronger export-oriented enterprise sector. The program will support reforms that incentivize productive investment and technology upgrading in the manufacturing, agribusiness and trade logistics sectors; and put in place enabling conditions that can progressively increase labor market flexibility and skills development. The medium-long term objective is to create better job opportunities and increase the economic growth potential. The DPL will support reforms that incentivize investment and technology upgrading in manufacturing, agribusiness and trade logistics. In parallel, the DPL policy actions will lay the groundwork to increase labor market flexibility and the development of job-relevant skills. This operation is an important element of the 2010 country partnership strategy, directly advancing the outcomes under the Competitiveness pillar. The DPL will also contribute to the inclusive growth pillar in regards to improving employability by reducing impediments to hiring and to the green growth pillar in regards to aligning the agriculture sector with European Union (EU) requirements. The operation will contribute to deepening reforms for improved competitiveness, one of the main strategic priorities in the 2012 Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regional strategy, particularly by establishing good governance for improved business climate, and making education and training systems more accountable for relevant skills."

There are five components to the project. The first component of the project is investment in HCFC-141b consumption reduction in the PU foam sector. This component will make provision of support to foam system houses to modify their production process, in order to provide hydrocarbon pre-blended polyol to enterprises that cannot adopt full-scale hydrocarbon technology. The second component of the project is investment in HCFC production reduction. The funding under this component will be used to compensate HCFC producers for surrendering their production rights in part or in full in order to contribute to the national compliance with the production freeze and 10 percent production reduction in 2013 and 2015, respectively. The third component of the project is technical assistance and policy support. This component will make provision of support to activities related to identification and testing of potential substitutes for HCFCs. The fourth component of the project is project management. This component will make provision of technical assistance to improve the capacity of Foreign Economic Cooperation Office of the Ministry of Environmental Protection (FECO) and the Project Management Office (PMO) to manage, supervise, coordinate, monitor and evaluate the implementation of the project. The fifth component of the project is preparation of HCFC phase-out activities post 2015. This component scoping and preparation of activities and relevant studies as needed on HCFC phase-out beyond 2015."

The DPL to Indonesia for US$100 million is designed to assist the Government of Indonesia (GoI) to strengthen the policy framework for improved national trade logistics, transportation, and ICT and trade facilitation. In developing the operation, the Bank and the Government considered several design alternatives, including the possibility of supporting such reforms through a single multisectoral DPL. The overall focus of the INSTANSI DPL, Connectivity DPL and Financial Sector and Investment Climate Reform and Modernization Development Policy Loan (FIRM DPL) is consistent with the World Bank's Development Policy Review (2008), and they are fully aligned with the 2009-2012 Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR). The connectivity DPL is expected to further enhance coordination and implementation of GoI reforms in the connectivity agenda, which is critical for accelerating growth to 7 percent and beyond, and continuing improvements in social outcomes over the medium term."

The INSTANSI DPL to Indonesia, for USD 300 million, marks the beginning of a new series of annual single-tranche DPLs. The operation is deeply rooted on the previous DPL series that consisted of: (i) first DPL series (DPLs 1-4), which was implemented from 2004 to 2007 and anchored to the FY04-08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS): (ii) second DPL series (DPLs 5-6) that was implemented from 2008-2009; and (iii) third DPL series, which was initially set out as a three-year DPL series (DPLs 7-9) to be implemented from 2010-2012. Initially focused on supporting the GoI's macroeconomic stabilization efforts, the previous DPL series covered a broad range of reform efforts aimed at improving the investment climate, strengthening public financial management and enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery. Given that the reform agenda is far from finished and an extension of the reforms is needed, the GoI has requested to terminate the ongoing third DPL series (DPLs 7-9) a year earlier and present the INSTANSI DPL as a new, two-year series. This new DPL series is still anchored under the FY09-12 country partnership strategy, and continues to deepen the reforms supported under the previous DPL series."

The objective of the operation is to promote the development of a sound, efficient and inclusive financial sector and support improvements in the investment climate in Indonesia to help the Government of Indonesia (GOI) achieve its medium-term economic development and poverty reduction goals. The Government has recently articulated its vision to turn Indonesia's economy into one of the world's ten largest by 2025. A sound and well functioning financial sector and an enabling environment for business are expected to contribute to the achievement of these goals. The main areas of policy and institutional reform supported under the loan will be: (i) reinforcing financial system stability; (ii) promoting financial sector diversification; (iii) enhancing financial inclusion; and (iv) supporting investment climate regulatory reform. The DPL is fully aligned with the Indonesia Country Partnership Strategy Progress (CPS) for the period of 2009-2012. Specifically, the report focuses on the core engagement areas of private sector development and social protection, as well as in its approach to support Indonesia's institutions. A new Indonesia CPS is currently under preparation and also includes a focus on private sector development. The FIRM DPL also includes an investment climate component that complements the ongoing financial sector reforms and reflects the Government's commitment to creating an economic environment conducive to private sector investment. Improvements in this area are considered critical for Indonesia to achieve its medium and long term growth potential."

This component was established based on an assessment of needs and lessons learned from prior technical assistance projects in Kenya, particularly the Financial and Legal Technical Assistance Program (FLSTAP). The second component of the project is Public-Private Partnership (PPP) pipeline preparation. This component for US$20 million will assist the government of Kenya (GoK) in ensuring that the first projects to come before the PPP Steering Committee (PPPSC) and PPP Secretariat (PPPS) are well-prepared, 'bankable,' and take into account lessons learned from previous PPP projects, the privatization program in Kenya, and regional and international experience. The third component of the project is improvements to Fiscal Commitment and Contingent Liability (FCCL) risk management framework. This component for US$5 million will provide support and guidance to the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and other relevant agencies on the fiscal commitment and risk framework associated with infrastructure, with an emphasis on contingent liabilities from PPPs. The fourth component of the project is support for program management. This component for US$3.5 million may include equipment, operating costs, organizational and systems development, training, capacity building and technical assistance."

The additional credit will finance costs associated with scaled-up activities under the project. The changes and additional financing activities will remain consistent with the Interim Strategy Note (ISN). The main reasons for reduced financing were that the project was introducing new concepts and reengaging financially in the agriculture sector and it was felt that a smaller initial investment would be more prudent. The changes to the project are: a) extension of the closing date of the original project; b) revised project development objective to remove the restriction on project districts and scale up the scope of the project; and c) revised targets of outcome indicators to reflect scaling up of investments. This will require an amendment to the financing agreement for the current project. Extension of the closing date is being sought to ensure enough time for the scaled up programs to be completed and results to be documented."

The operation is the second in a programmatic series of two development policy operations. The operation will be financed by International Development Association (IDA) resources of US$1.8 million and Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) is expected to provide associated sector budget support of AUD 5.0 million (US$5.3 million) for the same policy actions and dependent on the Bank's operation being approved. The operation will help the Government of Tonga manage severe economic challenges that have coincided with historic political reforms. It supports a focused program of Government reform priorities in public financial management, fiscal policy, and business environment reforms while providing a vital fiscal buffer in the context of sustained revenue contraction. The series of operations coincide with the term in office of Tonga's first Government to be selected by a majority-elected parliament and provide an opportunity for the Bank to support Tonga at a critical juncture in its development process. The programmatic series of economic recovery operations focuses on three reform areas. Areas of focus reflect Government's concern to support short-term recovery and mitigate continuing impacts of the crisis on the poorest households while maintaining progress against longer-term structural reforms to deal with ongoing fiscal and economic challenges. Areas of focus include: i) strengthening public financial management; ii) strengthening fiscal policy; and iii) promoting structural reforms relating to the business regulatory environment. The first Tonga Economic recovery operation also supported reforms to strengthen social protection. The Second Tonga economic recovery operation will build on the gains achieved to date. In the area of public financial management, priorities reflect the importance of embedding transparency and solid Public Financial Management (PFM) foundations following recent political reforms. Actions in this area include introduction of a treasury single account, publication of in-year budget reports, and the tabling in Parliament of audited Annual Financial Statements of Government. Under fiscal policy, the agenda focuses on strengthening revenue effort to maintain delivery of public services following substantial revenue declines. Actions in this area include policy decisions to introduce small business and natural resource tax regimes and measures to increase transparency of the costs of tax exemptions."

There are three components to the project. The first component is investment in HCFC-141b consumption phase-out. This component will support the cost of conversion to non-HCFC technology in the foam sector. It will consist of a series of investment activities (mainly procurement of equipment) at twelve foam producers. The project will promote the adoption of hydrocarbon technology in the foam sector, except in the manufacturing of integral skin shoe sole, where the water blown Carbon dioxide (CO2) system was found as the most cost-effective and suitable conversion method. Eligible incremental capital and operating costs for each enterprise has been determined on the basis of a conversion cost structure relevant to hydrocarbon/water blown (CO2) technology and subsequently approved by the Multilateral Fund Executive Committee. The second component is supporting policies and regulations and technical assistance activities. This component will provide technical assistance to the government agencies and involved beneficiaries and stakeholders to: (a) implement an import quota system to curb the supply of HCFCs; (b) recommend the government authorities not to issue licenses for establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities using HCFCs; (c) ban the import of bulk HCFC-141b by January 1, 2015 through the HCFC quota system; and (d) support workshops and training, awareness campaigns, and consultants' services (including studies) on the need to phase out HCFCs and on future regulatory measures. The third component is project management. A project management unit ('PMU'), under Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), will be established and financed to implement and coordinate project implementation and to assist MONRE to put in place regulations and sector specific policies."

The funding level of the Program is not sufficient to improve, in absolute terms, the road network condition on the National Road Network as a whole. In this context, the Program is expected to ensure that the condition of the National Road Network remains a given threshold, as reflected in the key results. Such results are deemed to be the best achievable outcome at network level when compared not only to the past declining trend shown but also to counterfactual situation prevailing in the absence of support to the Program. The Program will be implemented by: (a) the Road Department of the ministry of transport and public works, and (b) the Uruguay Road Corporation. The CVU (Corporacion Vial del Uruguay - Uruguay Road Corporation) is linked to the MTOP (Ministerio de Transporte y Obras Publicas -  Ministry of Transport and Public Works) through: (a) a concession agreement, making CVU responsible for managing part of Uruguay's main road network, including highway maintenance, rehabilitation, and, as needed, development; and (b) a technical assistance agreement, through which DNV provides technical and administrative support to CVU. The Program is implemented through contracts to the private sector (road and bridge rehabilitation, performance-based rehabilitation, maintenance or performance-based maintenance) or through routine maintenance works executed by DNV (Direccion Nacional de Vialidad - Road DepartmenT) directly. Usually, except for bridge rehabilitation and reconstruction (design-build contracts), design and supervision functions required by Program-related activities are carried out by DNV staff."

The diversity of the local conditions will ensure that the implementation of the adaptation activities in these pilot areas generates lessons learned that can be replicated on a broader scale through subsequent adaptation investments. The second component of the project is coastal wetland protection and reduction of vulnerability to the sea level rise in the Municipality of Corn Island. This component will support the activities in the Atlantic Coast region of Nicaragua, specifically in the Corn Island pilot Municipality. The third component of the project is institutional strengthening, project management and monitoring. This component will strengthen institutional capacity and coordination mechanisms at national and municipal levels to facilitate the integration of climate change adaptation into Nicaragua's water supply and sanitation and water resources management sectors."

      "cdata": "The development objective of the Second Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability and Growth Resilience Development Policy Loan (DPL) Program for Colombia is to enhanced fiscal sustainability and strengthened resilience of economic growth. The Government of Colombia has requested a DPL for US$200 million. The First DPL for US$300 million, approved by the Board in July 2011, supported the legislative approval of several important fiscal reforms. Building on the progress achieved under DPL I, this program document is the second DPL supporting the sustained implementation of these reforms. The request underscores the Government's continued interest in engaging with the World Bank to support its efforts in improving fiscal management. The fiscal reform program supported by the loan series seeks to enhance fiscal sustainability and strengthen growth resilience. The program includes a series of measures that can be grouped along three main policy reform areas: (a) budget predictability and stability, (b) social security liability management, and (c) disaster risk financing. The first area includes the implementation of a fiscal rule and a tax reform. The second area covers important legal and regulatory changes to the health insurance system, including the update of the mandatory benefit package and the creation of a contingency fund. The final area includes the development of a national disaster financing strategy and measures to enhance agricultural insurance coverage within a holistic agricultural risk management strategy. The Government of Colombia has made substantial progress in implementing its ambitious fiscal reform program. During the first half of the Presidential term, Congress approved a series of major fiscal reforms, including: a fiscal rule, a reform of the royalties system, a fiscal sustainability constitutional change, tax reforms, and a health law. As detailed in this document, the Government has made good progress in implementing this legislative agenda. The Bank is committed to a long-term engagement in support of the Government's fiscal reform program. The operation is fully consistent with the Bank's business model in Colombia, which emphasizes a strategic and integrated client engagement in support of selected development outcomes through three main lines of business, including financial, knowledge and convening services."

This DPL for US$260 million is to be implemented as a single operation with a Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO). Uruguay recorded a strong macro economic performance over the past nine years. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged more than 5 percent per year in the period the 2002 debt crisis. The year 2011 was the ninth consecutive year of GDP growth, marking one of the longest growth periods in the country's history. Prudent macroeconomic policies, improvements in structural areas and favorable external economic conditions, such as buoyant demand for its main export products and a booming regional economy, have contributed to the strong economic performance of Uruguay and helped protect the economy during the 2008/2009 crisis. Private consumption continues to be the main driver of the economy. As in previous years, with the exception of 2009, when GDP growth was driven by the external sector, private consumption was the main driver of economic growth. Private consumption grew by 7.6 percent in real terms in 2011, accounting for 6.1 percentage points of total growth. Gross domestic investment, fueled by still high levels of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows (4.7 percent of GDP in 2011), grew by 7 percent and explained 1.4 percentage points of GDP growth. Similar to previous years, the contribution from the external sector was negative, reducing GDP growth by 2.1 percentage points."

Vietnam is one of the country's most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Over the past 50 years, Vietnam has experienced a 20-cm rise in sea level and a 0.5°C increase in average temperature. Natural disasters already result in annual economic losses equivalent to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and there are serious concerns about meeting projected water uses. Recognizing the challenges posed by climate change impacts as well as by the need to shift the economy toward lower carbon emission, the GoV has demonstrated significant commitments to a stronger policy and institutional framework to respond to climate change across sectors. These commitments are specifically reflected in the GoV's Support Program to Respond to Climate Change (SP-RCC). This national policy and institutional reform program follows annual policy matrixes developed jointly with development partners and approved by the Prime Minister. The World Bank-financed climate change Development Policy Operation (DPO) programmatic series supports the implementation of the SP-RCC and is arranged under three pillars and four goals. The series is designed to support the GoV to define priorities and targets suitable for each stage of development through three annual programmatic operations. DPO2 was designed in close coordination with SP-RCC co-financiers as a continuation of DPO1. Beyond joint policy dialogue with the GoV, coordination with the program co-financiers includes building synergies in Technical Assistance (TA) and advisory services."

The additional financing will be used for: enabling the completion of original project activities (19 percent of the additional loan amount) by restoring the portion of the original loan amount that has been used for the emergency rehabilitation activities associated with the natural disaster of January 2011 in the Serrana region; and scaling up the project's impact and development effectiveness (81 percent of proposed additional loan amount). The additional financing will not result in any change in the project's development objective. The additional financing will be accompanied by an extension of the closing date of the project from November 30, 2016 to November 30, 2018. This two-year extension would be necessary to complete the activities to be initiated between 2012 and 2016, as the project gradually expands to new areas."

There are two components to the project. The first component is infrastructure investments in urban regeneration of Tskaltubo and tourism circuits' development. A first component includes the following sub-components: 1) urban regeneration of Tskaltubo. An integrated approach for the urban renewal of Tskaltubo city: this includes a) rehabilitation of municipal infrastructure and utilities in the central area; b) upgrading of public spaces, parks, and construction of tourism amenities, and c) restoration of public buildings with vernacular architecture. The activities will help improve livability and hospitality in a culturally-informed manner, enhance attractiveness for visitors, revitalize the urban nucleus, and attract increased volume of private sector investments around the medical and spa tourism cluster. 2) tourism circuits development: an integrated approach to site upgrading and improved management of the six most attractive cultural heritage sites in Imereti: including Gelati Monastery; Vani Museum and surrounding archaeological site; the Ubisa Church; the Katskhi Church, the Katskhi Column Monastery, and the Motsameta Monastery. This includes a) improving urban landscaping and public parking; b) construction of information kiosks and public toilets; c) restoration and refurbishing of the exterior and interior of the Vani Museum; d) improving access roads; and e) preservation of selected cultural heritage sites. The second component is institutional development. The second component includes the following sub-components. 1) establishment of Tskaltubo destination management and development office: this will create the institutional framework to ensure proper operation and maintenance of all assets that will be constructed/rehabilitated in Tskaltubo, and conduct marketing and promotion activities for the Imereti region; 2) sustainable tourism development and promotion: this will promote Imereti as a new sustainable tourism destination and create a mechanism for community participation, stakeholder consultations, and involvement of local government in the region's tourism development; 3) preparation of visitor management plans for the sustainability of the project's cultural heritage sites; 4) skilled workforce development and capacity building: this will provide demand-driven capacity building training activities to three groups in order to establish a targeted, integrated workforce development program in tourism-related businesses in the Imereti region; 5) performance monitoring and evaluation; and 6) construction supervision support: this will provide Municipal Development Fund (MDF) with construction supervision from an international consulting firm."

      "cdata": "The development objective of the Competitiveness Development Policy Operation Program is to improve competitiveness and thereby increase the volume of Moldovan exports, especially in European Union (EU) markets; and improve access to finance thereby promoting investment-led growth. This program document presents a Competitiveness Development Policy Operation (DPO) for an amount of US$30 million. This is a single operation supporting the efforts of the Government of the Republic of Moldova to enhance growth through export competitiveness and increased access to finance. The Government's program for the period 2011-2014 represents a transition from the stabilization and recovery agenda to establishing a strong basis for growth driven by investment, innovation and competitiveness. The operation builds on and deepens the growth and trade-oriented structural reform agenda started under the economic recovery development policy operation, which was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on June 24, 2010. The Government of the Republic of Moldova has an opportunity to implement reforms that would put the economy on a more sustainable export-led growth path. Emerging from the global economic crisis, Moldova's economic growth resumed swiftly in 2010 and 2011; however, the current Euro area crisis is likely to result in a slowdown of growth in 2012 and in the medium term. Moreover, despite the recovery in 2010 and 2011, job creation remained weak. The main driver of growth in 2010-2011 was private consumption, suggesting that the economy could be returning to the pre-crisis pattern of growth. Before the crisis, a decade of growth with weak job creation created a vicious cycle of migration, remittances, exchange rate appreciation, declines in tradable sectors, joblessness, and thus more migration. Heavy reliance on remittance-funded consumption and housing construction leaves the economy vulnerable to changes in the external environment and undermines Moldova's long-term competitiveness. The operation addresses binding constraints to economic growth by improving the returns to private investment and reducing the costs of finance."

This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide a pre arrears clearance grant in the amount of SDR52.6 million (US$80 million equivalent) to the project. Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the East Asia and Pacific Region, with an estimated gross domestic product per capita of between US$500-800. While reliable poverty data are scarce in Myanmar, all indicators point to poverty being concentrated in rural areas: two rounds of household surveys (in 2005 and 2009) supported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) highlight significant differences in poverty across geographical areas, with rural poverty considerably higher than urban poverty. Available figures also suggest that social indicators are poor; with for example 32 percent of children under five suffering from malnutrition, the highest rate in the region. Agriculture is the mainstay of the national economy, generating 43 percent of gross domestic product, 54 percent of employment and providing livelihoods to more that 70 percent of the population. However, the sector is characterized by a number of constraints, including limited irrigation; little value added agro processing capacity, poor policy settings, and widespread indebtedness in rural communities. Fundamental to the triple transition is a 'paradigm shift' to a 'people-centered approach,' as articulated by President Thein Sein. This encompasses greater attention to the delivery of services, a greater proportion of government budget to health and education, and a shift from 'top-down' to 'bottom-up' planning. This shift holds out the promise of change in state-society relations, following a half century of rule by successive military governments. The project will support this paradigm shift and 'people-centered' development by enabling poor rural communities to lead the identification of needs and implementation of activities aimed at promoting access to basic services and rural infrastructure. This will both empower communities and allow the government to deliver visible results of reform at the community level. In addition, the project will engender more constructive relationships between government and communities, and will support rural poverty alleviation, a stated objective of the government's economic reforms. If successful, the project, which will be implemented in 15 of Myanmar's 330 townships, can be scaled up across the country."

      "cdata": "The development objective of the Sixth Programmatic Development Policy Grant Program (PDPG6) for Tajikistan is to protect basic services within a sustainable fiscal framework, and to lay the foundation for post-crisis recovery and growth. The PDPG6 of SDR 13.2 million (US$ 20 million equivalent) is the third in a programmatic series of three operations for the Republic of Tajikistan. The PDPG4-6 series is central to the World Bank's engagement in Tajikistan, as envisaged in the FY10-13 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). It supports the government's two-pronged strategy to mitigate the impact of the global crisis and to pave the way for post-crisis recovery and poverty reduction. The series builds on the PDPG1-3 series completed in 2009, and seeks to (i) protect social spending and increase its efficiency, (ii) improve the climate for private sector development, and (iii) strengthen government effectiveness. PDPG4 and PDPG5 focused on protecting earlier social sectors gains, and on improving the environment for private investment. The 2008-09 global economic crisis adversely affected Tajikistan through lower remittances and exports. Growth slowed to 3.9 percent, PDPG6 supports the economic recovery underway following the 2009 slowdown. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has recovered to more than 6 percent in 2010 and 2011. Accordingly, the focus of the PDPG series has shifted from protecting earlier social sector gains to improving the environment for private sector development and strengthening government effectiveness. PDPG6 supports continued implementation of health and education financing reforms and ongoing efforts to improve targeting effectiveness of social assistance. To help spur private sector-led growth, the government has submitted a new law on public private partnerships to Parliament in August 2012, and has continued expedited issuance of land-use certificates to farmers. It has introduced a new salary grid in all central government entities, submitted a new law on public administration to Parliament which was approved in May 2012, approved the chart of accounts for public institutions, and prepared the 2012 budget based on the new budget classification."

      "cdata": "The development objective of the Urban Local Government Strengthening Program Project for Tanzania is to improve institutional performance for urban service delivery in program urban local government authorities. The growth outlook for Tanzania continues to remain optimistic, although there are certain risks. The economy is estimated to grow by 6.8 percent in 2012, slightly lower than the previous year. The medium term growth outlook remains positive. Achieving a buoyant outlook is dependent on addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, structural reforms, and carrying out sound public finance policy and public financial management. However, this remains vulnerable to domestic and external shocks including the Euro zone debt crisis. The level of foreign aid is already projected to decline significantly in FY2012/13. Fiscal consolidation for the central government is on track and is in line with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) policy support instrument program. The budget framework for 2012/13 is expected to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), closer to the level before the global financial crisis. The latest debt sustainability analysis (June 2012) shows that Tanzania's risk of debt stress remains low but is sensitive to borrowing terms and the government's fiscal position. Given the uncertainties in the external environment and the public investments through parastatals, Tanzania needs to manage its fiscal and debt sustainability. In 2004, Government of Tanzania (GoT) introduced the Local Government Capital Development Grant (LGCDG) as a grant flow to local governments. Prior to the introduction of the LGCDG, direct development grants to Local Government Authority (LGAs) were minimal and not performance based. LGAs received certain additional development resources from sectoral development programs and from area-based development programs. The LGCDG has evolved into the Local Government Development Grant (LGDG) program with several sub-programs and has become a mainstream performance based fiscal transfer. By introducing LGDG the government program the Government created a formula-based, transparent and predictable fiscal flow mechanism to disburse funds to all 133 LGAs in the country, on the basis of the institutional performance achieved. The main thrust of the LGDG system is to incentivize the improved institutional performance of LGAs while providing discretionary and sector-specific funding for development purposes. The LGDG system's chief goal is to improve the overall, long-term functioning of the local government system in Tanzania, so as to improve the quality of investments. More specifically, its objectives are to:1) enhance the delivery and management capabilities, productive efficiencies and financial sustainability of local governments; 2) improve access of communities especially the poor, to local services through expanding the physical stock of new and rehabilitated infrastructure; 3) improve the sustainability of local development infrastructure through ensuring proper planning and adequate operations and maintenance (O&M); and 4) provide a national system for the delivery of development grants to LGAs."

The main change introduced is the revision of the monitoring indicators (excluding project development objective, or PDO-related indicators) and targets. Specifically, some indicators have been revised to better capture project outcomes and the target values for components 1 and 2 have been modified to reflect the scaling-up of project activities. Target values for component 3 have been fully achieved during implementation of the Parent Project (PP) and are not being modified since this component will not be scaled-up.  The AF will support the scale up of two of the three components (components 1 and 2). All components have met their targets; the decision to scale up only activities under components 1 (La Paz) and 2 (El Alto) is based on the Borrower's decision to prioritize investments in the poorer areas of the country. The AF will extend the closing date of the PP to October 31, 2015. In addition, the PP financing agreement will be amended to reflect the changes."

This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional credit in an amount of SDR16.5 million (US$25 million equivalent) to the project. This will be the project's first Additional Financing (AF). The AF will support the scale up of an agricultural input subsidy which has successfully contributed to the expansion of maize and rice production in the country, the improvement of national food security, and the withdrawal of an export ban on grains trade. Specifically, the AF will finance a 30 percent increase in the number of farmers receiving input subsidies during the 2012/13 cropping season. This expansion in program coverage is critically important in the context of high international fertilizer prices, and rising international grain prices. The funding will help Tanzania maintain self-sufficiency on grain production. The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania (GoT) has requested continuing International Development Association (IDA) support for its input subsidy program. This was anticipated in the Tanzania Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), with the expectation that the commitment would be defined within the next phase of the Agricultural Sector Development Project (ASDP). However, the development of this commitment has been postponed to allow for a more strategic review of sectoral coordination and performance. The new ASDP funding is now only expected to be available in late 2013. The AF will support the maintenance of the subsidy program during the 2012/13 gap year."

There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is sub-grants to deprived districts to support key education objectives. The objective of the district grant is to provide annual non-salary resources to deprived districts as a supplement to existing resource flows, to support districts' Annual Programs of Work (APW) and government strategic priorities identified under the Education Sector Plan (ESP) and Annual Education Sector Operational Plan (AESOP). The second component of the project is school sub-grants. The objective of this component is to provide a supplement to the above described capitation grant with an explicit focus on improving access to and quality of education services as priority needs are defined at the school level. The third component of the project is project management and institutional strengthening. This component will finance: 1) consultancy services for supporting independent monitoring and evaluation, improved school supervision, implementation of School Report Cards (SRC); 2) In-Service Education and Training (INSET) and Untrained Teachers Diploma in Basic Education (UTDBE) materials and costs related to managing INSET delivery; 3) monitoring surveys and impact evaluation; 4) training materials and costs related to providing the training programs; 5) internal and External audits; and 6) operational costs for project management and training programs."

The second component is community, marketing and productive infrastructure. This component will cover investments in marketing and post-harvest infrastructure, critical community-level infrastructure, and investments identified by producers to increase agricultural productivity. The third component is project management and institutional strengthening. This component supports project management, including the monitoring and evaluation functions of the project. It covers: (a) technical and financial management, (b) procurement, and (c) supervision of compliance with environmental and social safeguards. This component will strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MoAF) to effectively coordinate implementation and provide procurement support to local communities as needed. This component will also support midterm and end-of-project project monitoring surveys that would provide project performance information at the activity, output, and outcome levels to meet the requirements of the existing Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) monitoring system and the Planning and Monitoring System (PLAMS)."

The DPC2 reinforces reform areas supported by the First Development Policy Credit (DPC1) and builds the earlier policy-based operations. The DPC2 is aligned with World Bank's strategic directions set out in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY11-14). The main risks are: (a) aggregate demand pressures could linger resulting in persistent rupee shortage. Mitigating factors include: recent monetary and fiscal tightening; a calibration of capital spending by the Royal Government of Bhutan, or RGoB based on foreign grants or loans; and commitment at high levels of the RGoB (in close coordination between Ministry of Finance, the Royal Monetary Authority, in consultation with the World Bank) to targets as evidenced by quarterly review of macroeconomic performance. The expansion of the existing line of credit with the Government of India as well as the currency swap arrangement should help ease pressures on the rupee; (b) capacity constraints due to the small scale of government, mitigated by the RGoB's ongoing capacity building efforts (in many areas supported by development partners); and (c) political risk of changing government priorities, mitigated by the RGoB's wide consultations on the development agenda and its commitment to sustaining reforms."

This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional credit, with an extension of the original closing date by six months, in an amount of SDR 15.8 million (US$24 million equivalent) to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. This Second Additional Financing (AF) under the project is to help meet increased financing requirements for the procurement of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) necessary to implement the National Emergency Action Plan 2012 for Polio Eradication in Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan (GoP) through the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) letter dated June 15, 2012 has requested the Bank to provide additional financing to continue the support to GoP's PEI. With the AF for the TPPEP, International Development Association (IDA) will continue its support in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) with support from the UN technical agencies: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United National Children's Fund (UNICEF). The GoP appreciates that there may not be a 'buy down' arrangement as there has been in the past. However, the BMGF has expressed an interest to provide funds to an IDA administered TF for extending the 'buy down' mechanism for the additional financing."

There are five components to the project. The first component is Panchayat Sarkar Bhawan. This component involves construction and making functional Panchayat Sarkar Bhawans in approximately 300 gram panchayats. The second component is capacity building for Panchayat Raj Institutions. This component builds panchayats' core institutional competencies to empower them to achieve substantive development outcomes. The component also engages communities and citizens, through training, mobilization, and media, to participate in local governance and to hold panchayats accountable. The third component is strengthening the state government capacity to manage a gradual decentralization and empowerment process. This component will strengthen the state government capacity to manage a gradual decentralization and empowerment process. The fourth component is panchayat performance grant. The annual best panchayat grant will reward exceptional panchayats that are inclusive, responsive and accountable. The recipients of the grant will be selected on a competitive basis. The competition criteria will include core institutional quality indicators related to how a panchayat runs its administration, how it interacts with its citizens, and how it manages resources and promotes local development. The competition will be based on objective information collected through the project information system with a validation process. Annually, the project will recognize the best gram panchayat in each district and block, and award them block grants, which are significantly higher than what they currently receive. The project will support this league of good panchayats to develop high impact initiatives that the grants will finance. The fifth component is project management and coordination. Government of Bihar (GoB) has established a Bihar Gram Swaraj Yojana Society (BGSYS) as the implementation agency for the project. The society is expected to play four critical roles: (i) A catalyst role: public awareness campaign, policy advocacy, innovative capacity building for visible development results, proactive partnership with Non-government Organizations (NGOs) to stimulate demand for accountability and improve PRI responsiveness; (ii) a technical support role: to support partner line departments to establish capacity in managing the devolution process and building PRIs capacity in the relevant service delivery area; (iii) a coordination role: coordinate, monitor and report on the devolution and PRI strengthening process; and (iv) a fiduciary role: project financing management, procurement and reporting. This component will finance staffing and operational cost of the society."

This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an Additional Financing (AF) Grant in the amount of SDR 23.3 million to the project. The AF will scale up a well-performing project (US$65 million equivalent ongoing) and finance modified project activities for all three components focused on recovery and reconstruction following the January 12, 2010 earthquake. It will support additional activities which are expected to enhance the original project's impact and development and address pending challenges to overall sustainability of the reform process. The AF will not entail any substantial change to the IIERP development objective. Institutional arrangements for project implementation of the AF will also remain unchanged. The project will continue to be implemented by Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications (MTPTEC). Specifically, the AF will help finance the following modified and additional activities: a) improve efficiency and transparency in public resource use and strengthen Haiti's public sector management systems to improve overall governance and anticorruption and enhance the institutional foundation for continued reconstruction and post reconstruction recovery; b) ensure continuity of existing critical activities related to the continued reconstruction phase, including the restoration of key economic and financial functions of the Government of Haiti (GoH), and the rehabilitation of selected public infrastructure; rehabilitate the aviation safety equipment, and foster further economic recovery through continued activities at the Trutier Debris Processing Facility, as well as rehabilitate existing roads between Cap Haitien and Labadie, and between Milot and Cap Haitien, both catalytic investments for tourism development; c) continue the provision of support to the MTPTEC to manage the ongoing recovery and reconstruction process, and incremental costs of project administration, supervision, monitoring and evaluation."

It will further strengthen the governance and institutional structure of Societe Guineenne du Patrimoine Minier (State-Owned Guinean Mining Company) (SOUGIPAMI) and its technical, legal, and financial capacities to engage with mining projects sponsors. The second component is institutional strengthening for mineral management. This component will focus on strengthening the GoG capacities to license, control and monitor technical, environmental, and financial compliance of mining operations. The third component is promoting economic development of mining areas and good governance. This component will focus on sustainable investments. This will include the facilitation of regional and local development plans through partnerships with the private sector, and the strengthening of mechanisms for demand for good governance (DFG). This component will have a regional aspect, in that it will most likely focus on at least one 'growth corridor,' (iron-ore in the South-East or Bauxite/Alumina in the North-West). It will build on work carried out under previous studies, and seek synergies with International Finance Corporation (IFC) and other donor activities. The fourth component is project management.

Furthermore, the project will contribute to raising public awareness and education standards in forestry issues in general, with specific reference to forest fires prevention/control and forest governance issues. There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is enhancing forest fire prevention, management, and control. This component aims to improve the effectiveness of forest fire prevention and management by: (i) improving the capacity for early detection and quick response to fight forest fires, and (ii) reducing the number of fires of human origin through awareness raising and environmental education programs. Early fire detection is recognized as a key element in improving protection of forests from fires. Fire prevention and environmental education will be focused on children and youth as a means to encourage long-term behavior change. The second component of the project is building forestry and Protected Area (PA) management capacity. This component will increase forest and PA management capacity and help address key policy and management issues that either create perverse incentives or exacerbate conditions contributing to the extent and intensity of fires in the extensive forest landscape and protected areas. The third component of the project is project management will finance the operating costs of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which will undertake project management functions for both components one and two. The PIU will provide support to the core implementing agencies (Federal Forestry Agency (FFA) and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE)) in project management, including procurement, financial management, project coordination, reporting, and monitoring. The PIU has been selected on a competitive basis by a committee formed by the implementing agencies, the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economic Development. The PIU will act on the basis of agency agreements on behalf of and per instruction from the FFA and MNRE."

To achieve those objectives, this series assists the government to implement reforms that will: (i) improve the business climate; (ii) enhance transparency; (iii) improve public financial management; (iv) improve targeting of social assistance; and (v) increase fiscal controls in public enterprises. The program will support the authorities with critical knowledge and technical assistance for implementing reforms. Analytical underpinnings for the reform program will be provided by existing and programmed analytical work. Analytical work that has already shaped the government's ongoing reform agenda includes public expenditure reviews, a strategy for strengthening budget management, a public financial management performance report, a review of administrative barriers to private sector development and business environment in the Seychelles, and a review of the policy regulatory and administrative environment. The government greatly values the technical assistance and policy dialogue that the bank can provide through its DPLs. Technical assistance in this program will be funded partly by reimbursable technical assistance. The bank brings global knowledge about good practice and helps to ensure evidence-based discussions around the reform agenda. That approach is particularly important in this context, where the reform agenda is ambitious, capacity is weak, and external factors call for accelerated reforms."

There are three components to the project. The first component is road rehabilitation. This component will finance the rehabilitation and upgrading of the M-03 road between Lubny and Poltava. The civil works to be funded from the loan will cover about 108km. The M-03 road connects the industrial areas in eastern Ukraine to Kiev, and is also part of the European road corridor E-40. Physical works will include the rehabilitation of the existing 4-lane road sections and the widening of other sections from two to four lanes, to ensure that the entire road is in line with the Ukrainian motorway standard. In addition to the increase in road capacity and the improvement of road conditions, this component will result in major road safety benefits. Widening to four lanes will greatly reduce the risk of head-on collisions, which are today the main cause of crashes and traffic fatalities of this road. The second component is road safety improvements. This component will finance two types of activities: (i) safety improvements along several high risk road corridors; and (ii) introduction of improved road safety features on the existing M-03 sections in urbanized areas which will remain even after bypasses will be built around those under component one. For the former, a comprehensive road safety assessment is being carried out under the ongoing RSIP, using the risk mapping and star rating approach of the International Road Assessment Program (IRAP). The third component is institutional support and strengthening. Under this component the Bank will complement the institutional assistance already being provided by other development partners, in support of the Government's concept for the road sector reform program enacted through the Cabinet of Ministers dated August 3, 2011. This component will support: (i) the development of a strategic program for road sector development until 2030; and (ii) the enhancement of the capacity of Ukravtodor, the Ukrainian State Institute for Design of Roads (Ukrdiprodor) and other Ukrainian institutions, for designing and building safer roads. Technical assistance will be provided to help Ukravtodor in developing a strategic program for road development, covering also institutional strengthening, financial sustainability and the social and gender dimension of the program."

There are three components to the project. The first component is performance grant. This component focuses on two areas of urban governance: resource planning and management, seeking to improve decision making, consolidate revenue sources and strengthen resource mobilization; and transparency and voice in the preparation, monitoring and evaluation of plans and programs in urban areas. This component will provide an annual grant to the project cities, based on achievement of specified annual targets against a set of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) in selected governance areas. The second component is project implementation and capacity building. This component supports the cities and province through technical assistance and capacity building to achieve the DLIs and enhancement in revenue. The Urban Sector Planning and Management Services Unit (USPMSU), and a City Program Unit (CPU) in each of the five cities will be responsible for providing this support and the corresponding costs will be financed from this component. The third component is contingent emergency response. This component will support preparedness and rapid response to disaster, emergency, and/or catastrophic events, as needed. The provisional zero cost for this component will allow for rapid reallocation of credit proceeds from other components under streamlined procurement and disbursement procedures. This component could also be used to channel additional funds should they become available as a result of the emergency."

There are two components to the project. The first component of the project is Word Bank (WB)-Supported IIGF Guarantees. The Project will provide US$25 million to support IIGF in issuing its own IIGF guarantees for qualifying projects. Qualifying projects will be those which are apprised by the WB and meet WB policies as well as other reputational risk considerations. In order to prevent the mingling of this $25 million with IIGF capital, the WB loan proceeds under component one will be disbursed at the time a claim is properly made and assessed as payable by IIGF with respect to an IIGF guarantee for a WB-Supported IIGF-project. The second component of the project is technical assistance (TA). The Project will provide a loan for TA in the amount of approximately $4.6 million to develop IIGF's institutional capacity to: screen, appraise and supervise IIGF-projects as a single window for all government guarantees for infrastructure PPPs in Indonesia; manage its operations; build capacity in Contracting Agencies (CAs), sponsors and other relevant parties; develop standardized documents and procedures for contracting agencies, sponsors and other relevant parties to use in preparing PPP projects and require the use of such documents and procedures in order for PPP projects to receive IIGF guarantees; and support PPP preparation activities, including feasibility studies, transaction advisory support and other activities."

There are three components to the project. The first component is system expansion and reinforcement. This component will cover construction and reinforcement of 110 kV, Medium Voltage (MV) and Low Voltage (LV) electricity distribution networks, including substations, of the PCs. These investments will help the PCs to efficiently meet load growth, address load supply constraints due to distribution system congestion, reduce losses, and improve reliability and quality of power supply. The second component is introduction of smart grid technologies in distribution. This component, which includes Clean Technology Fund (CTF) co-financing, will focus on (i) automation, through introduction of supervisory control and data acquisition systems, of electricity distribution network operations of and data collection by the PCs; and (ii) introduction of Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems, including two-way communication systems, as electricity distribution smart grid technologies for key substations and consumers of selected PCs. Supporting the first stage of the roadmap for smart grid technologies for power distribution in Vietnam, the component will assist to increase efficiency, reliability and effectiveness of the PCs' systems and operations, and optimize distribution system configuration by providing real time data from both the supply and the demand side. The third component is technical assistance and capacity building. Provision of technical assistance to and capacity building of Electricity Regulatory Authority of Vietnam (ERAV) for improvement of efficiency in electricity tariffs, enhancement of efficiency of and incorporation of smart grid technologies in the grid and distribution codes, integration of renewable energy in the grid and distribution codes, development of demand response and smart grid programs, and project management and monitoring and evaluation. Building on the technical assistance and capacity building under on-going Bank projects and the Bank support to power sector reform and tariff regulation, third component will complement the investment in the previous two components through building capacity and implementing arrangements to maximize improvements in PCs' efficiency and achieve reductions in demand compared to Business as usual (BAU), to achieve project development objectives and indicators."

This component will strengthen the supply and demand-side interface of the ICDS program, especially at the point of delivery of nutrition services, and will rigorously monitor and evaluate this interface. The component will focus on excluded and marginalized groups. The development of a management model that emphasizes efficiency on the basis of mutual accountability between caregivers and beneficiaries will be a significant area of support. The third component is convergent nutrition action. This component will support the Government of India's efforts to initiate, and subsequently expand, a comprehensive convergent nutrition response to complement the ICDS, in order to address the multiple determinants of malnutrition. The fourth component is project management, monitoring and evaluation. This component will support effective project management including: (i) financing specialists in a variety of fields to strengthen the operation of the established Project Management Units (PMUs) at the central and state level. Support will also include financing of office equipment, renting of vehicles, travel costs for key program staff, participation in planning/review/dissemination workshops, participation in study tours and conferences in order to facilitate a cross fertilization of ideas and an assimilation in the program of nutrition related best practices, and incremental operating costs; (ii) financing administrative costs of a technical agency to provide required technical support for program implementation, including the cost of core teams at the central and state levels, their office expenses and travel costs for training and evaluations; and (iii) the monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes, including designing an independent impact evaluation study, carrying out a baseline survey as well as annual rapid assessments on program coverage and behavior change, quarterly internal assessments by ICDS supervisors in randomly selected Anganwadi Centers (AWCs), and social assessments and an ethnographic study in minority and hard to reach areas to assess service delivery and effectiveness of communication outreach. The component will also support evaluation of all project pilots and best practices and the dissemination of the findings."

This program document presents a DPL in the amount of US$300 million for the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This DPL is designed to assist the Government of Rio de Janeiro (GORJ) in continuing its efforts to improve fiscal management, social service delivery in health and education, and public financial management. Although requested as a stand-alone DPL, the operation forms part of a long term quasi programmatic engagement with the State. It is the third DPL operation with the state of Rio de Janeiro. The policies supported by this third DPL are part of the GORJ's medium-term reform program and would deepen and extend the areas covered by the first DPL. Specifically, the operation will support measures to: (i) improve the efficiency of tax administration; (ii) improve budgetary management, including screening and evaluation of new public investment projects, better estimating costs of new policy initiatives, and strengthening internal controls; and (iii) increase quality and efficiency of the education system, by introducing merit-based selection processes for school managers, annual school-level performance targets, and performance-linked pay, and in the health system by increasing the efficiency of health spending, both in regional hospitals and smaller municipalities."

      "cdata": "The development objective of the Eighth Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO 8) Program for Lao PDR is to support policies and institutional reforms that enable the sustainable management of increasing revenues from the natural resource sectors to deliver improved public services. This will enable the country to more effectively translate these revenues into better development outcomes and improved public service delivery. The five policy areas in the new PRSO directly support the strategic objectives of World Bank's new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of (i) improving competitiveness and connectivity, (ii) sustainable resource management, (iii) inclusive development, and the crosscutting theme of strategic public sector management. Additionally, this third PRSO series builds on lessons learned from the previous second PSRO series. To ensure impact and results from the previously supported reforms, the third PRSO series continues support in some policy areas while aiming to selectively open new fronts of support for reform to meet the country's development challenges that include diversified and inclusive growth. The preparation of the new PRSO series included extensive consultations with all stakeholders, and close cooperation with the European Commission (EC). This PRSO series arrives at a critical time as Lao PDR's economy benefits from abundant natural resources, which, if managed well, may put the country on a sustainable and inclusive medium-term growth path. Lao PDR's forests, agricultural land, water and mineral resources and hydropower potential account for more than half of the country's total wealth. With appropriate macroeconomic and governance policies, the country's natural resource wealth can contribute significantly towards rapid, sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Rapid expansion of the hydropower and mining sectors has benefited the country by contributing towards general economic growth, increasing fiscal revenues significantly, and reducing local poverty and improving infrastructure. It has also promoted change in environmental legislation."

This component will involve: constructing and rehabilitating non-motorized transport facilities, including foot paths, cycle tracks, pedestrian bridges and underpasses; and carrying out feasibility and detailed engineering design studies of roads adjoining major towns and studies for improvement of traffic flows through provision of technical advisory services. The second component is the support to Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) and Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) to develop selected mass transit corridors. The activities under this component of the project, which include carrying out feasibility studies and detailed engineering designs and preparation of bidding and contract documents for works and associated facilities as well as selection of private sector operators to provide large capacity buses for a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system and rolling stock for a commuter rail system are a precursor for a successor project. Finally, the third component is the institutional strengthening and capacity building. This component will support and deepen the implementation of reforms in the transport sector with a major focus on urban transport."
